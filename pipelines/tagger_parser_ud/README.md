# ü™ê spaCy Project: Part-of-speech Tagging & Dependency Parsing (Universal Dependencies)

This project template lets you train a part-of-speech tagger, morphologizer, lemmatizer and dependency parser from a [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) corpus. It takes care of downloading the treebank, converting it to spaCy's format and training and evaluating the model. The template uses the [`UD_English-EWT`](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT) treebank by default, but you can swap it out for any other available treebank. Just make sure to adjust the `lang` and treebank settings in the variables below. Use `xx` for multi-language if no language-specific tokenizer is available in spaCy. Note that multi-word tokens will be merged together when the corpus is converted since spaCy does not support multi-word token expansion.


## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `preprocess` | Convert the data to spaCy's format |
| `train` | Train UD_English-EWT |
| `evaluate` | Evaluate on the test data and save the metrics |
| `package` | Package the trained model so it can be installed |
| `clean` | Remove intermediate files |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | `preprocess` &rarr; `train` &rarr; `evaluate` &rarr; `package` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets)
in the project directory.

| File | Source | Description |
