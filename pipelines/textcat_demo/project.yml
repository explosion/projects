title: "Demo Textcat (Text Classification)"
description: "A minimal demo textcat project for spaCy v3. The demo data comes from the [tutorials/textcat_docs_issues](https://github.com/explosion/projects/tree/v3/tutorials/textcat_docs_issues) project."

# Workflows are sequences of commands (see below) executed in order. You can
# run them via "spacy project run [workflow]". If a commands's inputs/outputs
# haven't changed, it won't be re-run.
workflows:
  all:
    - convert
    - train
    - evaluate
    - package

# Project commands, specified in a style similar to CI config files (e.g. Azure
# pipelines). The name is the command name that lets you trigger the command
# via "spacy project run [command] [path]". The help message is optional and
# shown when executing "spacy project run [optional command] [path] --help".
