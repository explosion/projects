title: "Named Entity Recognition (WikiNER)"
description: "Simple example of downloading and converting source data and training a named entity recognition model. The example uses the WikiNER corpus, which was constructed semi-automatically. The main advantage of this corpus is that it's freely available, so the data can be downloaded as a project asset. The WikiNER corpus is distributed in IOB format, a fairly common text encoding for sequence data. The `corpus` subcommand splits the corpus into training, development and testing partitions, and uses `spacy convert` to convert them into spaCy's binary format. You can then edit the config to try out different settings, and trigger training with the `train` subcommand."
