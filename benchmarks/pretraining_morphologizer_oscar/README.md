# ü™ê spaCy Project: Enhancing Morphological Analysis with spaCy Pretraining

This project explores the effectiveness of pretraining techniques on morphological analysis (morphologizer) by conducting experiments on multiple languages. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the benefits of pretraining word vectors using domain-specific data on the performance of the morphological analysis. We leverage the OSCAR dataset to pretrain our vectors for tok2vec and utilize the UD_Treebanks dataset to train a morphologizer component. We evaluate and compare the performance of different pretraining techniques and the performance of models without any pretraining.

## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| `train` | Train a morphologizer component without pretrained weights and static vectors |
| `evaluate` | Evaluate the trained morphologizer component without pretrained weights and static vectors |
| `train_static` | Train a morphologizer component with static vectors from a pretrained model |
| `evaluate_static` | Evaluate the trained morphologizer component with static weights |

| `reset_metrics` | Delete the metrics folder |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `data` | `download_oscar` &rarr; `download_model` &rarr; `extract_ud` &rarr; `convert_ud` |
| `training` | `train` &rarr; `evaluate` |
| `training_static` | `train_static` &rarr; `evaluate_static` |
| `training_char` | `pretrain_char` &rarr; `train_char` &rarr; `evaluate_char` |
| `training_vector` | `pretrain_vector` &rarr; `train_vector` &rarr; `evaluate_vector` |
| `training_trf` | `train_trf` &rarr; `evaluate_trf` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets)
in the project directory.
