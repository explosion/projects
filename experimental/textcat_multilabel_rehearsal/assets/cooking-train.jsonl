I have heard <strong>great</strong> things about induction ranges, but my biggest reservation there is that I'll need to replace a fair bit of cookware. Personally, I have no experience using induction.</p>\n<p>My question is mainly directed at those who have used both induction and gas, but if you've used either that's ok as well. <strong>So, given a choice between induction or gas, which would you choose?</strong> </p>\n<p>P.S. - Not sure if this should be a community wiki, but if so I'm good with that.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>\nI was hoping to hear from someone who uses an induction range. The <em>ideal</em> answer would be something like, \"I've used gas and induction and when I bought a new range I bought \"x\" and here's why\". Anyway it's not an ideal world...</p>\n<p>My issue is that I have used gas for cooking and know lots of others who do as well. I have one friend who used an induction range in a vacation home, and her take was that she hated it at first, but then came to like it. Another friend has a countertop induction burner, but he's not a cook as he just uses it to boil water. The thing is that induction ranges are not very common in the U.S. or at least among people I know.</p>\n<p>So, to refine what I'm interested in.... If you are an avid cook, and have used an induction system, \"Is it responsive?\", \"Is it controllable, in that say, you can set a burner at 180 and it'll stay there?\", \"Is it durable and easy to clean?\".</p>\n<p>Also, my reservation about replacing cookware pretty much went away. I found flooring materials through salvage for less than half of what I expected to pay. That pretty much opened up my budget if I decide to go with induction rather than gas.</p>\n<p>Finally, what I really need to do is find a way to test drive an induction range. I'll be checking in with some local shops to see if there is a way to accomplish that. </p>\n<p><em>And by the way, I have of course googled on this.</em></p>\n<p>Thanks for the input so far.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Another Update</strong></em></p>\n<p>I was hoping to get more comparative <em>experience</em> in using gas and induction. I suppose I didn't get much of that because induction ranges do not have wide usage in the U.S. market. </p>\n<p>I <em>know</em> that I generally like cooking on gas ranges. My main concern with gas is indoor air pollution. Somewhere among my bookmarks is an article about particulate matter and CO generated by gas ranges. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, I really like some of the things I've read about induction ranges. Efficiency, safety, control, etc. </p>\n<p>My final decision on what I actually wind up purchasing is down the road a bit. Hopefully, I'll get to \"test drive\" an induction range in the meantime.</p>\n"}

From the Harvard article above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But this is nutrition, and nothing in\n  nutrition is simple. Italian\n  researchers published results in 2008\n  of an experiment comparing three\n  cooking methods — boiling, steaming,\n  and frying — and the effect they had\n  on the nutritional content of\n  broccoli, carrots, and zucchini.\n  Boiling carrots actually increased\n  their carotenoid content, while\n  steaming and frying reduced it.\n  Carotenoids are compounds like lutein,\n  which may be good for the eyes, and\n  beta carotene. One possible\n  explanation is that it takes longer\n  for vegetables to get tender when\n  they’re steamed, so the extra cooking\n  time results in more degradation of\n  some nutrients and longer exposure to\n  oxygen and light.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>So, my questions are</strong>: Is microwaving <em>known</em> to kill nutrients in foods?  Is there a way to minimize this effect?  Can any nutritionists weigh in here with their experience, and ideally, the science behind their answers?  This has been a very confusing research path full of conflicting information, so all answers are appreciated.</p>\n"}

There is also a greater concentration of water, so to speak, outside of the turkey than inside. Here, too, the water will naturally flow from the area of greater concentration (the brine) to lesser concentration (the cells). When water moves in this fashion, the process is called osmosis. <strong>Once inside the cells, the salt and, to a lesser extent, the sugar cause the cell proteins to unravel, or denature.</strong> As the individual proteins unravel, they become more likely to interact with one another. This interaction results in the formation of a sticky matrix that captures and holds moisture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This makes it sound like sugar isn't really an important part of the osmosis process.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a chemical/molecular reason to add the sugar, or is it just to add some flavor to the chicken breast?</strong></p>\n"}

I <a href=\"http://theitaliandish.blogspot.com/2009/03/spatchcock-chicken.html\">butterflied</a> the chicken and patted it as dry as possible inside and out with paper towels.  I then mixed up some olive oil, lemon juice, salt, cracked pepper, chili powder, onion powder, and cumin and liberally applied it all over the skin.  I'm not sure I really managed to completely flatten the chicken, as I'm fairly weak and it was a large bird, so the butterfly technique wasn't perfect.  I put it under a pre-heated broiler and started out following <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/magazine/30food-t-001.html\">this</a> recipe, with the chicken cooking for about 6 minutes skin-side up, then 6 minutes meat-side up, then I put the oven on 375 degrees F (190.5 degrees C) with the chicken skin side up.  Ever time I flipped it I poured some of the collected juices over the bird.  Because the bird was so big, it wasn't done after about an hour of cooking when I needed to leave, so I put the broiler on low for about 3 minutes before leaving, and then I shut the oven off to keep from charring my chicken and burning the place down.  At this point the thigh was around 140 degrees F at the thickest part.  I was gone for about an hour.</p>\n<p>When I returned, my spouse didn't want to eat the chicken until we'd verified that it had come to temperature, so we turned the oven back on to 400 degrees F (204.4 degrees C) for a few more minutes.  The bird went way beyond minimum temperature - the thickest part of the thigh was well over 175.  I expected it to taste disgustingly dry.</p>\n<p>Instead what we had was the most moist, tender roasted chicken I've ever had.  The skin was crispy, the meat fell off the bone (literally when we moved it off the rack).</p>\n<p>What was it about this accidental cooking method that worked so well?  Did the time in the hot-but-not-on oven do anything?  Was it just the initial recipe and the size of the bird?  The basting?  I'd love to reproduce the flavor and texture of my chicken, but do I need all the accidental steps?</p>\n"}

Tonight I tried one of iSi's recipes, which uses the following ingredients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>250 g goat cheese</li>\n<li>125 g sour cream</li>\n<li>125 mL cream</li>\n<li>1-2 tbsp olive oil</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Preparation is basically to purée the goat cheese, sour cream, and oil, mix in the cream, strain it through a sieve, load it into the whipper, then charge and cool it.</p>\n<p>At the <em>denouement</em>, I was greeted with a brief but ominous <em>fizzle</em> followed by an even briefer <em>splatter</em> of yogurt-like liquid, very much like the explosion of snot one witnesses after somebody sneezes a little too hard.  After clearing the cheese blobs from my shirt and hair, I proceeded to scrape the remains (which was in fact the majority of what went in there to begin with) with a rubber spatula and spread it on some crisp toast; it was delicious in spite of not even being remotely close to an espuma.</p>\n<p>I'm well aware, as the manual makes sure to mention about half a dozen times, that the whipper will fail to perform any actual whipping if the fluid inside is too thick or viscous.  I was quite skeptical myself, before charging it in the first place, but until now I haven't really tested the limits of this thing, and I figured, if I was able to strain it through the sieve (with much mashing, I might add) then it would be whippable.</p>\n<p>So I already know, superficially, why this failed, but that only leads me to a deeper <em>why</em> which I have been unable to answer myself:  Why did this happen with one of <em>iSi's own recipes</em>, found in the very recipe book that is included in the same box as the whipper itself?  I have to assume that iSi knows what they're doing and it was me that screwed up; but how?  What did I do wrong and how could I have fixed it?</p>\n<p>Some possible avenues of investigation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>There are a great many different types of goat cheese available; I used the standard soft/unripened type, but there are also goat cheese \"spreads\" that are probably less rich.  Perhaps the recipe was actually referring to one of these?</p></li>\n<li><p>I used ordinary (14%) sour cream; perhaps the fat content was too high and the recipe intended for light or even fat-free sour cream?</p></li>\n<li><p>I had a lot of trouble actually puréeing the mixture; using a blender, I found that the mixture didn't really move around much, so I had to keep scraping it back into the center so that it would hit the blade.  The recipe actually says to use a blender <em>or food processor</em> but I assumed that a blender would be <em>better</em>.  Should I have used a food processor instead, or maybe even a stick blender?  Would any of this have actually made any difference, given that the consistency of the final mixture was very smooth (albeit thick)?</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Are any of these likely to be the root cause?  Is there anything else I might be overlooking?</p>\n"}
