11 It works for me!. I used to feel sore at my throat easily in the past.  In the last few years, I have been suffering from eczema as well.

13 Great for reflux issues. My husband has persistent (but not severe) reflux, particularly when he lays down to sleep at night on his side. I research and found that aloe vera juice can greatly help. He has been doing a small shot (I fill a shot glass half full) before breakfast and dinner. And he has felt a significant improvement!

14 Works like a charm. No, it's not good to party hardy but if you know you're going to, take a few of these FIRST and there is no hangover. It seriously works for me anyway. Also makes most of my PMS/menstrual cycle symptoms disappear since the liver breaks down estrogen and it can use help at that time of the month too.

29 a good product. I started using it a year ago and it was the only one what stopped my hair from falling. After 3 months of usage I noticed a short hair all over my head. After 6 months I started using only 1 tablet a day. Although currently I'm again suffering the hair loss, therefore started to take 2 tablets a day. And I need to admit, that despite a hair loss I still can see a new short hair growing.

52 High in thujone. My doctor recommended it for hot flashes, 5 cups daily, 2 before bed for my night flushes. Within 2 weeks, this worked, but I've read that this regular sage contains thujone that can be toxic at more than 6 cups a day and it's uncertain if long term use is safe. Apparently Spanish sage is very low in thujone, but I can't find where to buy it.

Some people broke out quite badly after taking B5 in the first few weeks, but this hasn’t happened on me yet (hopefully will not)!

P.s. it’s currently winter here, will update later how skin becomes in summer (when it usually gets oily).

151 It actually works. I had an episode of hair loss following a period of rather poor health. I started taking BioSil about 6 weeks ago and I must say, the results have been much better than I expected. I am now seeing lots of new hair sprouting and, as an added bonus, my skin tone has also improved! Bits of my eyebrows where I used to have to fill in with make-up have now filled out on their own. And I haven't even finished a bottle of it yet. Will continue taking this for a few more months. Happy customer :)

238 Excellent sleep aid. Really enjoy the taste and the effect it has. Puts me to sleep in 15 mins tips and I do not feel that 'hangover' that some other melatonin supplements give you.

244 So Far So Good By Somer Jaye. Just started taking one per day for bone health. See my profile for description of recent back diagnosis. Pills are small and easy to take.  Must take with a fat, so I take at lunch time. Sometimes hard to make sure fat invested as I am following an anti-inflammatory diet to help as well.  But pill is easy to swallow and small - it’s a liquid capsule.  Don’t forget you need Vit K as well and I’ve researched M7 to be the best form.

306 Fantastic help for diabetics. This product has positively helped in the control of diabetes.  A family member has proven through a doctor that this taken with a meal has helped to make them feel full and helped to keep the blood sugar level at a more controlled level..  The one suggestion I would make is to be sure to add it to enough water to let it conpletely disolve (about 6 or 7 minutes) before mixing it with juice and adding stevia.

308 Great for my insomnia. I dont know really why, perhaps because of the b vitamins, the tryptophan, the iron, its anti-allergic and anti-rinhitis effects or its pineal gland detox effects, or perhaps because all of them.
Mixing a small spoon of spirulina with extra virgin oilve oil before bed has made wonders with my insomnia.
I am much calmer, my sleep is deeper and i breath better.
I dont like the fact that its made in Taiwan, but its usa and eu organic.

Excellent it healed all my nails from fungus ditto my fungus skin on the feet, but it really needed time for it so I treated my food nails every evening and morning with Neem Oil and only after ½ a year all my nail looks totally shiny, healthy and clean. The smell can offend if we have to see people. Therfore I used it on the hand nails basically at bed time, however it did an excellent job to me. Now as a precaution I remain using it just once a week..

331 Sustained release works well (but can still cause stomach upset). I tried this product to address complications of diabetes and side effects of medications from a knee surgery.  The sustained release formulation works well.

So keep an eye out for that!

336 Recommend!. They definitely make a difference. I have experienced better energy levels and an improvement in my skin (as compared to taking no vit supp). Good bio available forms of B vitamins have helped with stress tolerance and general mood as well I think. For the price I don't know if there is a better quality supp out there. My only wish is that the capsules weren't made of gelatin. Happy Aussie buyer

373 Better And Less Expensive Than Allergy Shots. For years I hated Spring. The Cottonwood trees were the bane of my existence. I slept through the most beautiful time of year because of antihistamines. I started using BioAllers  Tree Pollen.  It helped relieve the scratchy throat and eyes symptoms right away but after 3 season I didn’t react to the Cottonwood anymore!  I’d recommend this to anyone.  20 years later, I started having mild symptoms again and once again these drops did the trick.

I took only one pack and I saw the result. It is nice, that Selenium is with vitamin E together in this complex represented. It is also important that it is a number of different forms of selenium in one pack, it works better as only one. I recommend it not for every day, but 1-2 times in a year.

450 Mitochondrial function and heart repair. I have genetic problems that lead to too little CoQ10 synthesis, and it affects my heart and my overall condition. The symptoms are bradycardia, hypothermia tiredness and slow movement. I don't take CoQ10 all the time, only when these symptoms occur. I tried softgels to see if they absorb better than powder. All I can say so far is that both work equally well. I like Natural Factors... they have some great products.

497 Excellent product. Love this product.  Helps with many health issues for us.  We also place directly on a nasty wound.  We also use another myrrh product - Hanford's Balsam of Myrrh -Have used this all my life.  It is for external use only.  Really aids in healing - does burn on any injury where the skin is open but worth the sting.

505 Sticky. Okay as a condiment (altho it's not quite as salty as other Kelp products), great for face masks or even a plant fertilizer (dissolves in water 100%).

Not as good for taking it straight as a supplement powder, because it's very very sticky and it's not very tasty compared to other Kelp products that I've tried, it's actually slighly bitter sometimes and the color is light green (not dark brown).

509 This baby makes you sweat!. Quite sweet, reminds me of Fruit Tingles (sherbet confectionery) I take  a scoop mixed with 200ml water & immediately drink it pre-workout. I can confirm, that I sweat sooo much during a bootcamp session and increased because of the capsimax - crossing fingers it's burning the fat! I'm not "ripped" yet but I guess it comes with time. So 5 stars for Sweat.

Since I will be breastfeeding for a long time (at least a year), I will have to find someone else to give this tea to.

630 Do not order this item if you live in Austria. I ordered this product with delivery to Austria and got fined as a result. 

Apparently it is against the law to do so and you will receive a fine and / or jail sentence for doing so.
