{"text":"# Blender Addon for importing OpenMVG SfM reconstruction results\n\nHi Pierre,\r\n\r\nI am working on a Blender Addon (https://github.com/SBCV/Blender-Addon-Photogrammetry-Importer) that allows you to import different photogrammetry data formats into Blender. The latest version supports now OpenMVG JSON files.\r\n\r\nI can imagine that this tool could be useful for other OpenMVG JSON files users as well. It offers for example a nice way to visualize the reconstruction results (including cameras and image planes).\r\n\r\nOne can use Blender's camera animation tool to render the reconstruction. The camera animation in Blender offers many useful options to define the camera motion. You can define for example the camera path in 3D and add looking constraints for the camera.\r\nFurthermore, you can load different models (with different file formats) into Blender at the same time. So you can for example render a point cloud and the corresponding mesh at the same time (e.g. to highlight differences).\r\nI used it for example to compare reconstruction results of virtual data with the corresponding virtual environment.\r\n\r\nFor Blender users:\r\nYou can use OpenMVG instead of Blender's camera tracking tool to reconstruct the scene. Which is way more comfortable, since Blender's camera tracking requires a lot of user interaction to compute reasonable results.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to inform you about that. Maybe you want to add a reference to the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to close this issue.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nSebastian","title":"Blender Addon for importing OpenMVG SfM reconstruction results","body":"Hi Pierre,\r\n\r\nI am working on a Blender Addon (https://github.com/SBCV/Blender-Addon-Photogrammetry-Importer) that allows you to import different photogrammetry data formats into Blender.

This RFC would like to discuss some details and write out the roadmap. I know there has been some internal discussions among @mufeili and @VoVAllen about the drug/chemical dataset/applications. I hope you could also summarize it a bit and improve this RFC. This RFC is likely to be broken down into several PRs (for example, #748 is a good start), so having a roadmap is quite important to track the progress.</p>\n\n<p>The problem of the current DGL examples is that\n(1) Reusable modules are scattered in many training scripts, making them hard to be accessed by the end users.\n(2) We need to add <strong>way more</strong> modules and layers due to the increasing demand from the community. This has severely impeded DGL from more adoption.\n(3) The organization is not clean. Each example is put in its dedicated folder. We should have a better hierarchy to organize them (possibly by application type).\n(4) Example codes are not included in CI, making it hard to maintain.</p>\n\n<h2>Proposal</h2>\n\n<p>To fix this, this RFC proposes the following changes:\n(1) Move as many layer/module components as possible from examples to <code>nn</code> namespace. These modules should be <strong>functional</strong>, has graph object in the argument to allow dynamic graph, and has clear documentation. We also need to implement them for both mxnet and pytorch.\n(2) Try organize modules in the following categories.\n  * Graph convolution (<code>conv.py</code>)\n  * node-level classification/regression\n  * link prediction\n  * graph classification\n  * graph pooling (<code>glob.py</code>)\n  * graph generation\n  * <code>loss.py</code>\n  * <code>metrics.py</code>\n  * Other functional APIs (e.g. softmax)\n  * ...</p>\n\n<p>Note that we could include any utilities that may not depend on DGL. They could be evaluation metrics, loss, score or any functions that are common and useful. However, they are still in <code>dgl.nn</code> namespace.\n(3) Curate more datasets. The question here is whether we are confident that our data format is able to cover all of them. @VoVAllen may have more opinions on this. Otherwise, we will continue the current practice. If using raw dataset, we could directly download it from the official site and construct graphs online. Otherwise, we may need to preprocess the data to generate graphs and store it in our own data format.\n(4) Reorg the examples by applications:\n  * Community detection\n  * Recommender system\n  * Graph classification\n  * Network embedding\n  * ...</p>\n\n<p>Suggestion from @classicsong: It's better that we could have a unified entry point of each. For example:\n<code>bash\npython examples/recsys/train.py --dataset=movielens100k --model=gcmc\n</code>\nThis allows the users to easily compare baselines.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it is a good time to finally refactor and write more docstrings for these modules. We could also take this chance to enable lint check on <code>dgl.data</code> module and move sampling routines to DGL main packages.</p>\n\n<h2>Check List</h2>\n\n<p>@mufeili @VoVAllen @yzh119 @zheng-da and anyone who are involved. Please directly edit this post to add items. We could estimate the workload from this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Model Zoo</strong></p>\n\n<p>Graph convolution (<code>dgl.nn.&lt;backend&gt;.conv.py</code>)\n- [ ] RGCN (PR #744 )\n- [ ] GraphSAGE (PR #748 )\n- [ ] GAT\n- [ ] GGNN (PR #748 )\n- [ ] ChebyNet (PR #748 )\n- [ ] GIN (PR #748 )\n- [ ] SGC (PR #748 )</p>\n\n<p>node-level classification/regression\nTBD</p>\n\n<p>Link prediction\n- [ ] Bilinear decoder\n- [ ] Distmult</p>\n\n<p>Graph generation\n- [ ] DGMGDecoder (?)</p>\n\n<p><code>loss.py</code>\nTBD</p>\n\n<p><code>metrics.py</code>\nTBD</p>\n\n<p>Functional APIs (<code>dgl.nn.functional</code>)\nTBD</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dataset curation</strong>\nCommunity detection\n- [ ] TBD</p>\n\n<p>Graph classification\n- [ ] TBD</p>\n\n<p>Recommender system\n- [ ] MovieLens</p>\n\n<p>Network embedding\n- [ ] TBD</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example reorg</strong>\nCommunity detection\n- [ ] </p>\n\n<p>Graph classification\n- [ ]</p>\n\n<p>Recommender system\n- [ ]</p>\n\n<p>Network embedding\n- [ ] Node2vec\n- [ ] Metapath2vec\n- [ ] DeepWalk\n- [ ] [Poincare](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08039.pdf)</p>\n","meta":{"source":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/issues/756"},"_input_hash":-1683641159,"_task_hash":1353898522,"_view_id":"choice","answer":"reject","label":"DOCUMENTATION"}

The internet is full of varying quality guides for hardening SSH with very little reference to reputable STIG or other similar frameworks for secure configuration. I think the vision for this project is fantastic, it should streamline things for many people but I think it's important to track why baseline settings are chosen, citations for any particular attack vectors and noting some of the tradeoffs for the decision. Otherwise it feels like just an extension of \"cargo cult\" style blog posts where everyone is offering their chosen secure settings with little critical evaluation on why this setting was chosen.</p>\n\n<p>Are you able to provide some background on this setting?</p>\n\n<p>I'm happy to open a PR for the ansible-ssh-hardening to update the documentation/faq to flag this, unfortunately as Ansible uses SSH as the control channel it's particularly sensitive to these types of issues! </p>\n","meta":{"source":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/dev-sec/ssh-baseline/issues/137"},"_input_hash":-1645937047,"_task_hash":-636649304,"_view_id":"choice","answer":"reject","label":"DOCUMENTATION"}

IN NO EVENT SHALL MCCI BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO MCCI OR THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall MCCI&#39;s total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

(Did you publish code or a test case that exhibits the problem?)\n-->\nMbed-OS v5.12</p>\n\n<p>I'm using a custom CMake build process because I have requirements that mbed-cli is unable to accommodate.  </p>\n\n<p>I want to set up a rtos-less build.  I've seen issues #7800 and #7794.  I have no problems with eliminating the files those two issues cover, but I've also seen a reference to bare-metal in https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.12/tutorials/migrating-to-mbed-os-5.html</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know what effect that configuration has - what defines are added or whatnot?  I tried grepping for bare-metal in the mbed-cli and tools directory but came up empty.  Is there a central source for the mapping of the directives in the json files to defines/files/etc that are added to the build process?</p>\n\n<h3>Issue request type</h3>\n\n<p><!--\n    Required\n    Please add only one X to one of the following types.
