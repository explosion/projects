# Entity Linking: disambiguation of "Emerson" mentions in sentences 

This directory contains the datasets and scripts for an example project using 
[spaCy's Entity Linking (EL) functionality ](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#entity-linking) 
to disambiguate "Emerson" mentions in text to unique identifiers from Wikidata. As an example use-case, we consider 
three different people called Emerson: an Australian tennis player, an American writer, and a Brazilian footballer.

Roughly speaking, the following steps are performed in this project.
First, a pretrained model is used to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER). 
Then, we create a Knowledge Base (KB) in spaCy that holds the information of the entities we want to disambiguate. 
In this example project we consider three different people called "Emerson": Next, we use [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy) to create some manually 
annotated data with a custom annotation recipe. Finally, we create a new Entity Linking component in spaCy, 
and train it with this annotated data. We test the model on a few unseen sentences.

> ðŸ“º **This project was created as part of a [step-by-step video tutorial](TODO LINK).**

## Scripts

All code to create the KB and the EL component in spaCy, can be found in [`el_tutorial.py`](scripts/el_tutorial.py). 
Alternatively, you can execute this code in a Jupyter notebook: [`notebook_video.ipynb`](scripts/notebook_video.ipynb). 
Both files cover the same steps:
 * Read in a pre-defined CSV file with the information to construct our Knowledge Base
 * Parse the manually annotated data and convert it to the right training format
 * Create a new entity linking pipe and train it
 * Apply the entity linker to some unseen data to test its performance

## Prodigy annotation

To perform the manual annotation in Prodigy, we have written a custom recipe [`el_recipe.py`](scripts/el_recipe.py).

As input, the file [`emerson_input_text.txt`](prodigy/emerson_input_text) contains 30 sentences from Wikipedia containing just 
the mention "Emerson" and not the full name. These sentences are then annotated with Prodigy by executing the command
```
prodigy entity_linker.manual emersons_annotated emerson_input_text.txt my_nlp/ my_kb entitites.csv -F el_recipe.py
```
The final results are stored to file with 
```
prodigy db-out emersons_annotated >> emerson_annotated_text.jsonl
```
This JSONL file is included here as well in the [`prodigy`](prodigy) subdirectory so the scripts can be run without 
having to (re)do this manual annotation.
