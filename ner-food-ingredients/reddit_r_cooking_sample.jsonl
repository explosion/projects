Simple as that. Learn to do it in a pan. It's almost as easy as boiling water. This question is a bit like \"how do I blanch vegetables in the oven\".

{"text":"There are tons of great macaroni &amp; cheese recipes, but the basic recipe is good to know, because the base of the cheese sauce, your basic white sauce, can be modified to any taste. You basically start by making a roux, which is equal parts butter &amp; flour (you can use oil instead of butter, but the flavor will change). I normally do 4 T butter to 1/4 cup flour. Melt the butter, then add the flour, and cook until it's golden, maybe around 5 minutes (don't skip this step, otherwise the sauce will taste like flour). At this time you can add salt/pepper/dried spices. Once that's incorporated, add milk (I use 2 cups), then cook over medium heat till bubbly. At this point, you can add shredded cheddar or any other type of cheese. I use cheddar with a bit of freshly grated reggiano parmesan. I'd use about 2 cups cheese total for this recipe. Be sure to add the cheese off of the heat; it will melt right in. Add to cooked macaroni, and you're good to go. But this recipe is great for adding things like cherry tomatoes, cooked broccoli or other vegetables, etc.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1528385383}}

{"text":"> Infrared radiation is the best method for delivering high heat to food on a grill. Charcoal grills produce a lot of direct scorching infrared radiation that is converted to heat when it strikes food. Gas and pellet grills produce mostly convection heat. > > Is IR heating better? Dr. Blonder says \"IR energy is delivered faster than convection, but slower than conduction. So it can brown a little more effectively than a conventional grill but not as fast as a hot pan or grill grates. There are fewer hot spots from IR cookers. On the other hand, you can get thermal runaway with IR. If one section of the meat is dark, it absorbs more IR than the lighter sections. It browns, becomes darker still, and eventually burns.\" While it's bad writing style to first make a statement and later question it, I also find the section misleading. Thermal runaway is a disadvantage ONLY compared to convection, which itself has a less uniform heating pattern. Due to the uniform heating pattern, I find coals and their radiation heating generally superior for sausages and chicken legs.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1406339450"}}

{"text":"I kind of loosely based my recipe off a couple I found, and it's different every time. I make mine with some other veggies. I start off by soaking the beans (2 cups) overnight, then rinsing them. Important step! Really improves the digestibility and cooking time. Double the amount of water as there is beans, plus a tablespoon of Apple cider vinegar per cup: see here for why. If you want I can find a more academic source for that but this was the first result on google. I promise it's legit * Pulverize in a food processor (or chop if you like more texture) onions, garlic, carrot, and bell pepper (+/- anything you like) in olive oil. (Use as much veggies as you like, but just know that the more you use the less bean tasting its going to be) * Season with chili powder, pepper, paprika, salt, cumin... Layer the seasonings, so do some when you first start the saute and then another sprinkling once its really soft * Let it all get really soft- cook it low and slow, make sure to stir. * Add the beans and enough water or stock (Last time I used a bunch I had leftover: chicken, beef, pork, and veggie) to cover the beans. Simmer until the beans are cooked. * Puree in a food processor or blender until its smooth. If you want it more bean-y only process a few scoops. This is why I use the food processor to mince the veggies, so it makes it really smooth. For the shrimp I usually use a bit of Sazon seasoning or just pepper and garlic. Lightly saute until pink. Top with a heaping spoonful of sour cream (I personally recommend Trader Joe's organic- OMG the flavor!) or shredded cheese. Or both. Because dairy.

{"text":"My one tip is that if you do any meat butchering, make sure you have a good knife. Don't be like my mother and try to butcher things with a serrated paring knife or something like that. You want a chef's knife or a butcher's cleaver, depending on how big the thing you are cutting is. You want it sharp and somewhat heavy. I know this sounds weird, but sharper knifes are safer because you need to use less force on the knife to get it to cut. Putting a lot of force behind a knife is how fingers get lost. You also want the knife to have a little heft because when butchering meat you do have to cut the occasional joint or small bone. Again, not a job for a pairing knife. Happy cooking, I'm hitting the hay but if you ever have questions, feel free to PM me.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1447226143"}}
{"text":"You know, every time I order out they never give me enough sauce so I end up making my own and I never regret it Mayo is a great base, and it's easy as fuck to make: 1Egg yolk' a little dollop of Dijon mustard, a squeeze of lemon juice in a mixer or blender. Turn it on and drizzle about a cup of olive oil in. Homemade mayo is always better. If I order sushi I mix that with wasabi, wasabi mayo is proof God exists. sriacha for deliciousness with fried stuff The juice from chipotle for Mexican flare Relish for tartar Buttermilk for a ranch dip Anchovy and mustard for Caesar dressing Another great base is basic yogurt Mix with garlic and cucumber for tzasiki Lemon and Herbs for just herb dip Capers and onions goes good on fish Horseradish too Ketchup and horse radish is cocktail sauce Mayo and ketchup is thousand island Mustard and mayo is just a good dip Then there's the mother sauces, most of them start with a roux: A roux is made by heating equal parts fat and flour. You leave it until the flour has been cooked. It should smell like toasted bread and take on a blonde appearance. Some recipes call for darker roux A bechamel is what happens when you add milk to your roux A veloute is what happens when you add a add a white stock like fish or chicken to your roux An espagnol is what happens when you add brown stock like beef or duck to your roux (it's also called gravy) A tomate is what happens when you add tomato pur\u00e9e to your roux Then there's emulsifications, mayo falls into this category. When something has been emulsified it means they are mixed until they cannot separate. You usually need an emulsifier, this keeps everything neat and tidy. A common emulsifier is egg yolk Hollandaise is what happens when you emulsify melted butter with air. Think of it as mayo. But instead of oil you're using butter. Put a stick of butter in a double boiler, add an egg yolk and get to whipping. It's amazing. You can easily make mustard by grinding seeds up in a coffee grinder, adding red wine vinegar and salt and letting it sit Ketchup is strained tomato sauce, sugar, and red wine vinegar Hot sauce fermented chili peppers. Add fresh hot peppers to a jar that's CLEAN, cover with salt. Cover and leave in a warm dark area, shaking it every other day, opening it to burp it every now and then. Pur\u00e9e and strain. You can make a basic Mexican sauce with dried peppers, I use ancho and guajillo. Toast and de seed them, make a bed of sliced white onions in a large skillet, add your peppers to the top of it, fill with about a half inch of beef stock, oregano and salt, cover and simmer for 30 mins. Pur\u00e9e and strain. Add tamarind paste and dark chocolate and cumin and cinnamon for a basic mole Grill tomatillos, peel, pur\u00e9e with onions, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, lime juice and garlic for a salsa verde. Grill Anaheim or hatch chiles, peel and chop with garlic for a New Mexico style green chili Add fish sauce to any of the above chili sauces for a Thai inspired chili sauce Equal parts fish sauce and brown sugar, water for a Vietnamese dipping sauce Fish sauce, peanut butter and soy sauce for a peanut sauce Fish sauce, brown sugar water and onions will reduce and make a great glaze for grilled chicken Equal parts soy sauce and rice vinegar with a touch of sesame oil for a Korean style dipping sauce Soy sauce and brown sugar makes teriyaki sauce Black bean hummus and fish sauce makes a really remarkable Korean inspired sauce for tofu Soy sauce mixed with tahini for a super great sesame glaze for chicken Soy sauce and lime juice is a great dipping sauce for fish or dumplings Rice vinegar and cucumber makes a great refreshing sauce for rice","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1465701722}}

Once the water comes to a boil, stir in the rice, cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook 15 - 20 minutes until all of the water has evaporated.

{"text":"Durability and weight mainly, a plastic board is much more susceptible to being knocked around simply due to being vastly lighter for one. Though that same lightness may be an actual benefit depending on how you see yourself using it. As for the durability a high quality wood cutting board if well maintained will last a *very* long time through a significant amount of abuse. Meanwhile plastic can only take so much before it needs to be replaced. Additionally wood has the benefit of looking significantly better (in my personal opinion anyway) and having the possible advantage of being turned into an entire counter/island for an absolutely massive work surface if you wanted to go that route. The main durability concerns are mostly going to be gouging into the board, especially if you are using something like a cleaver and swinging with force through bones you will quickly destroy a normal plastic board. Assuming you aren't going to be doing that it will still inevitability accumulate many little scratches that would be recovered in a wooden board during maintenance. If you intend on running it through the dishwasher its lifespan will dramatically decrease due to the likelihood of warping but I don't count that against it really since it isn't like you can through wooden boards through a dishwasher anyway. At the end of the day despite being a crazy elitist personally who loves his high quality wooden cutting board I'm pretty sure what you are looking for is a plastic one. Just make sure to get the biggest size the other person has room to put it since it really is a massive pain to work on a tiny little board. Plastic trades top end quality and lifespan for ease of maintenance and weight/thickness as well as being significantly cheaper and that sounds like where your priorities are at. Though for real make sure to tell them not to try and put it in the dishwasher, depending on the washer it really can ruin them really fast, plastic easily warps when heated and things get surprisingly hot in a modern dishwasher.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1551340452}}

It is not \"hard\" to cook with cheap SS, but it is more difficult I guess Of course you can produce amazing dishes with any pan, just maybe not as easily or consistantly The differance is mainly in conductivity, besides obvious advantages as ergonomics and the like. SS is a poor conductor, and being thin, only maximizes this. The result is a pan that does not heat evenly, and can not hold onto its heat well. This means uneven cooking(some things will burn while others will not even brown), extended cooking times from poor heat retention and of course the durability and susceptibility to warping/discoloration/chiping is a lot higher. High quality SS pans layers SS, Aluminum, Copper and Iron to take qualities of other metals and make a pan that gives you an incredible even heating surface that retains its heat well(or poor in some cases which can be a good thing).

{"text":"Hey there! I'm a butcher at a Jewel Osco. You got a fine piece of meat there. by the description you gave it sounds like it is a one bone rib roast, which is totally cool! They way i like to do it is you get it to stand up(easier said than done i know) and season the sides and top very thoroughly. preheat oven to 500 or right around there and once it is preheated you put the roast in STANDING UP. cook it at that high temp 5 minutes per pound so in your case exactly 13 minutes. Once that time is up turn off your oven and most importantly DO NOT OPEN YOUR OVEN. let the roast sit in there for 2 hours(this continues the cooking process &amp; rests the roast). This way of cooking it will produce medium rare, to get a bit more done just extend the time of cooking at 500(only a couple minutes at most though). It will come out tender and flavorful. I cook this every Christmas. Enjoy!","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1453859055}}

{"text":"> The results aren't going to differ all that much, if at all. I'm on your side here, but you are wrong. Many of us just know how to adjust a recipe so that it is perfect. I make bread, I always go light on the flour, and keep flouring the surface (working flour in) until I can feel that it's \"right\". But I did move to a scale for some recipes. One I had was from a german site, and it was in german, for banana chocolate brownies. And you know what - they were awesome, and a family favourite for years. But when I actually weighed the ingredients (after making it by volume for years), the recipe was still awesome, but quite different, more brownie-like, and less cake-like. So I think there is a lot of leeway for things to be different, and measuring versus weighing does make a difference, it's just that each way is probably acceptable (if not what the recipe maker intended)","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1542209580}}
{"text":"In school, I learned 3 basic types of battering. IRL(work), I apply them regularly, with varying functionality. First, the standard breeding procedure, or wet-dry-wet method. Alton Brown featured this method frequently, and stressed the all important \"wet hand\" and \"dry hand.\" This is traditionally Flour, egg wash (egg, milk), and your finishing coat (bread crumbs, flour, or cornmeal). This method will create a nice crunchy batter when fried. It is good for cheese, meats, poultry, vegetables. Second, the wet batter. This contains the famous Tempura style batter and Beer batter. Basically, mix flour with your wet ingredient. Dip what you want fried in the batter, and fry it. Usually, you will coat what your food in a starch of some kind before applying batter, but you do not always have to. Usually you see vegetables fried like this. Meat options I have seen are beer battered Cod and corn dogs Third is dusting or coating in the dry batter. This is used on seafood a lot. Fried oysters, calamari, shrimp. Also, anything \"lightly breaded\" is usually prepared this way. Basically, toss or coat your food in seasoned or plain flour, cornmeal, bread crumbs, etc. and cook. Often, the fried item in question will either be wet from its own juice already (like shucked oysters in a tub are) or will be in a bath or sorts (like soaking catfish filets in seasoned buttermilk).

You can do anything it - soups, stews, braises, spaghetti sauce, etc. The blue one is a soup pot. Le Creuset claimed that the curved sides coming up from the base make it easier to stir whatever is on the bottom without anything getting stuck/burned in the corner that you have on the dutch oven where the spoon might not fit. Functionally it's the same as the dutch oven in terms of what you can make in it. Soup is an obvious choice but it can really be used for anything. The main limitation of the soup pot vs. the dutch oven is that the soup pot is much smaller, and it's smaller bottom gives a lot less surface area to use for browning prior to adding the broth.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1388693381"}}

There are also recipes in it as well! I will also suggest that you stick with some classic pairings (usually French is most familiar to Americans). For example: beef is traditionally served with a simple pan sauce or a horseradish cream sauce. Salmon and dill are a no brainer! ( try taking those traditional pairings and seasonings and using them in creative ways, like horseradish cream mashed potatoes with steak, or dill and bacon creamed corn with salmon) Pairing a meat with something that it often eats is also a great strategy. EX: chickens eat grains, seeds, and even berries, so a roasted chicken breast with a balsamic berry sauce and some wild rice or farro is guaranteed to be delicious!

Those items should get you through most recipes fairly easily. A rice cooker is usually a good buy too since it can do a lot more than just rice. At least as long as the model isn't absolutely ancient. For example most rice cookers come with a steamer basket that you can use to steam a variety of things very easily (veggies, shrimp, pork bao, etc). You can also hard boil eggs as you cook rice (just place the eggs on top of the rice and press cook rice! Perfect hard boiled eggs every time) or steam them (without rice) for soft boiled eggs.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1529328632}}

This colorless, hygroscopic, and flammable tertiary amine has a strong \"fishy\" odor in low concentrations and an ammonia-like odor at higher concentrations. It is a gas at room temperature but is usually sold in pressurized gas cylinders or as a 40% solution in water. >Trimethylamine is a product of decomposition of plants and animals. It is the substance mainly responsible for the odor often associated with rotting fish, some infections, bad breath and can be a cause of vaginal odor due to bacterial vaginosis. It is also associated with taking large doses of choline and carnitine. >Trimethylamine is a nitrogenous base and can be readily protonated to give trimethylammonium cation. Trimethylammonium chloride is a hygroscopic colorless solid prepared from hydrochloric acid. Trimethylamine is a good nucleophile, and this reaction is the basis of most of its applications. --- ^(about) ^| *^(/u/UNHDude can reply with 'delete'.

{"text":"Everyone has their own recipe for sauce. My father's is different than mine, my uncle's, or my mother-in-law's. I grow a lot of tomatoes every summer, so I have a tendency to only make sauce in August/September in huge batches, and then freeze manageable portions in ziplock freezer bags. Fresh tomatoes make all the difference. While there are quality canned tomatoes out there, I prefer to use my own whenever possible. When I want pasta in January, it is as easy as thawing a bag of sauce and bringing it back to a simmer on the stove top. I blanch the fresh tomatoes to make skin removal easy, then I cut them open and deseed them. I always deseed into a screened strainer so I can catch the seeds, but retain the liquid that holds them (lots of flavor). I always use fresh herbs and garlic whenever possible (which is always). I like onions and celery in mine (2 med onion, 2 ribs of celery). I mince them rough and start them over low heat with kosher salt to sweat them soft. Once they are half way there I add several rough chopped cloves of garlic. Now I add my tomato paste to the pan and allow it to caramelize. This adds a depth of flavor to the sauce you can only get in this step. Deglaze the pan with a 1/2 cup of dry white wine and add the tomatoes. I use about 2-3 dozen or so depending on the size. Now add fresh herbs (basil, oregano, parsley (flat leaf), and bay leaf). Bring it to a simmer and let it cook for 90-120 minutes. A trick I learned from AB is to use a tsp of baking soda instead of sugar to balance the acid. A small quantity of baking soda will lower the acidity of the sauce, balancing the flavors and allowing the natural sweetness of the tomatoes to shine through. I usually add the baking soda about 1/2 way through the process.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1330618018"}}

Once cooked, as far as I understand it, it looses its positive properties and can actually be harmful - I've heard people claim this but I am having trouble finding any source. Perhaps a biologist or chemist can opine. Nevertheless, take any pan over high heat and let it get hot, but not so hot that it will scald olive oil in seconds. Also, preheat oven to 350, say. Season raw chicken directly. put in a tablespoon or so of OO and once shimmering, place chix in pan. Don't touch. Let brown. The chicken will release itself, even from a non-stick pan. Once it's cooked about 1/2 way through, just take the pan (assuming it's oven safe) and put the whole thing in the oven for 5-10 minutes. Don't undercook, but please... please... don't overcook the damn thing. Remove from oven and take out of pan. Let rest for a few minutes. Serve. No fancy dressing required as the browned meat has a lot of flavor.

{"text":"I don't know your cooking skills or your traditional ingredients, so I hope this helps. You mentioned you don't want to hunt down 18+ ingredients and I understand that - needing to find a ton of specialty ingredients for one dish can be exhausting, time consuming, and expensive. However, I would suggest expanding your basic spices and additives. Pepper, salt, chili powder, paprika, cayenne, cinnamon, onion and garlic powder, basil, marjoram, lemon and lime juice, soy sauce, chili oil, fish sauce, ginger... these are my basic staples in the kitchen. You can do tons of Latin, American, Spanish, French, Italian, and Chinese dishes with these (not all at once, obviously). And you don't need to get them all at once! Buying a new spice every couple of weeks to add to your cabinet allows you to cook with limited ingredients and understand what they bring to a dish, then adding a new one shows you how it impacts the flavor. If you're looking for gravy, learn how to make a roux (often melted butter mixed with flour, sometimes oil instead of butter. Depending on the recipe, you add spices after it's thick, sometimes after you've added meat/veggies/stock). This is highly customizable - you can start gumbo, some chilis, mushroom gravy for Jaegerschnitzel, alfredo, etc. If you're looking to start learning curries, most grocery stores have premade curries (both Indian and Thai). They will also often have paste which is meant to be fried and/or have liquid (can be stock, cream, or Coconut milk. Read the label and do research!) added to it while cooking. Once you start understanding the flavors, find a local Asian market/spice shop and pick up garam masala, chilis specific to regions of the world, etc. Also, you can typically find tons of spices for very cheap in much more bulk in Asian and Latin markets than a regular grocery store. I personally do meal prep with chicken because I like to find them on sale and have an easy dinner sitting in my freezer/fridge. Marinades are awesome. Lemon-Garlic: 2 tbsp lemon juice, minced garlic, 1-2 tbsp olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. Mustard: 1-2 tbsp olive oil, at least 2 tbsp dijon, splash of lemon, salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder, chili powder or cayenne for more spice. Honey-Dijon 1 tbsp honey, 2 tbsp dijon, minced garlic, salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder. Savory-Spicy: 1 tbsp Worchestire, 1tspish Fish Sauce, salt, pepper, cayenne, chili oil to taste (read, not a lot unless you are into super spicy), chili powder, paprika. I bake these and halfway through, top with more liquid. For example, the lemon one needs a bit of lemon juice and olive oil, the mustard one should have dijon put on, the honey one should have a little of both dijon and honey, the savory one should get some Worchestire and chili oil. It helps keep them moist! Also, as you put them in a container/bag to marinate, make sure to stab the chicken first with a fork to let all the ingredients seep in. I also suggest looking into some thicker dishes like Shakshuka. It's a Middle Eastern dish that focuses on a thick tomato sauce with eggs. It can be made sweeter for breakfast or spicy for lunch/dinner. I know you mentioned you don't prefer sweet, but do make sure to put in some sugar or it will taste off. Otherwise, it's tomatoes, bell peppers, hot peppers and a variety of spices. One pot for everything, pop in some eggs and cook them to whatever firmness you prefer! It's traditionally served with crusty bread, but I've seen it with pita and crackers. The last thing I'll suggest is roasted red bell pepper pasta. I have access to extremely cheap and tasty roasted bell peppers in a jar (I prefer them being softer), but you could easily roast them yourself if you have access to cheap peppers and a bit of time. Melt some butter, saute some onions until soft, add in minced garlic when the onions are a minute away, add in sliced roasted bell peppers, let it all meet for a bit. Blend it in whatever you have, put it back. At this point, you can add 1 cup of water, stock, or cream depending on what you want. Salt, pepper, dried chili flakes, a little chili powder, garlic and onion powder. Let it reduce for 5-10 minutes depending on what liquid you added. Throw in cooked pasta and it looks super fancy for super cheap and easy. And you can make it as spicy as you want! More chili flakes, chili oil, cayenne, jalapenos or habaneros (during the cooking process) all lend themselves well to this dish. Good luck and enjoy! Sorry for the wall of text. I just love suggesting ideas for newer cooks like myself.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1548182708}}

It'll be different than what you get in stores, but still awesome - like a cross between regular ham and pork tenderloin. I don't have a guide, but I can tell you what she did (sort of). Start with a fresh ham, obviously. You should be able to get one from a local farm/farmer's market, or a decent butcher. If you want a prettier pattern and crispier skin, score it in a crosshatch pattern. Brine it in a salt/sugar/water mixture for about 24-36 hours. (If you want to turn this into more traditional curing, you can add nitrates and leave the ham in for much longer.) You can also include spices in the brine, depending on the flavor profile you're going for. When it's finished brining, bake it in a pan filled with water (keeps it moister) and prepare a glaze. The glaze is probably where you'd wanna work the Bud Light in. A traditional glaze has is usually sweet and spiced, with brown sugar, mustard, cloves, etc...I imagine you could work beer into that.

Now with this little 'contraption' OP has going on, I'm guessing there's enough shit mixed up in the patty that the meat will get adequate separation and even cooking regardless of salting.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1380260291"}}

Your steak there (assuming that's a picture of the actual steak you cooked) looks to me like it wasn't cooked at a high enough heat. It looks light-brown in color, instead of a good dark-brown, almost black, like a properly seared steak should be. When you sear a steak, the pan is so hot that the fat melts and cooks; if you cook it in a pan that's too cool, the fat doesn't have a chance to melt and cook by the time the meat is done. And if you keep cooking it in order to melt the fat, the meat gets well-done. So what kind of pan did you use, and how hot was it? Read this. http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/12/the-food-lab-complete-guide-to-pan-seared-steaks.html See how dark-brown the steak is? with black bits?

{"text":"It is! Because the bigger company will have to first import products to their warehouse, further process, export to the country of the supermarket, have it sit in the supermarket warehouse, link up systems for restocking, and restock. That's the basic distribution, and it's already far more expensive than ours. Because our company buys in the same quantity as those large multinationals, and we have our own manufacturing / processing facilities, our raw material cost is the same, and warehousing cost for the specialist range is near nil in the big picture. Other independent retailers are also probably the same. Individual shipping may eat up margins, but ultimately it ends up cheaper because the bigger retailers also pay licensing fees, agency fees for buying, and a few others - none of which apply to the small ones who sell online. You're right about the ethnic stores sometimes having questionable quality. In a city like New York the general quality should be ok for whole spices, because you have a large community of people who will consume them, so whoever the importer is has more buying power. The only real issue I notice with them is hygiene, so you'll just have to do some manual selection yourself!

Profession was supposed to be professed but I was on a train and listening to an audio book, so it slipped past me. My point was that if you're cooking quick and dirty, at home, bachelor style; microwaved chicken from frozen is damn good. I discovered it when I was trying to defrost it and ended up cooking it. Once I refined the process, I found the results easily comparable to anything done on the stove top, excepting for sear but we're talking about chicken here, and we're trying to not make a production out of the production, so searing isn't in context. If you're hell-bent on getting that crust, once it's cooked, get out the blow torch and put a sear on it. I've been in more than one restaurant that used this trick to get things looking nice... Anyways, have a nice day, next time your hungover and all the dishes are dirty, try microwaving some frozen chicken. If you wanna get fancy, throw some bacon and butter into the mix with some spice.

{"text":"Alright mate, here is the deal. I'm by no means a burger master, but I make a decent burger out of necessity, as there are very few burger places where I'm at (Abroad). Meat: 80/20 mince, divide and lightly form into patties, make it thinner than you think and pinch the center a little (it will puff up don't worry). Season generously with salt (preferably of the kosher or coarse variety), and rub it in. Pepper will burn. On the pan, put in some oil (can be as little or as much as a few millimeters). Put the heat on high and wait for the pan to get hot (Oil just about to smoke), then put the burgers on and don't touch them! wait a few moments then flip using a spatula. Wait until the juices run clear (or not), put the pepper and cheese on top now if you wish. Take it off and let it rest for a few minutes. Now the second ingredient which is often overlooked is bread. Put the broiler on. Butter generously, or you can mix olive oil and warm butter and drizzle (or drench!) on the bread. Stick it in the oven face up (broiler!) until it starts to get slightly golden/crispy. A good bun makes all the difference. An old stale bun can make even the best burger meat suck balls. For toppings I recommend thinly sliced dill pickles, sauteed/carmelized onions, tomatos, and maybe lettuce. I use mayo on bottom and BBQ sauce on top.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1451460038}}

{"text":"there are a few sauces that I like to make to put on things like fish, or in sandwiches. I like to occasionally make some in a little saucepan and then store it in the fridge to quickly be able to spoon some out at a later date. the best example of this is a sauce that consists of orange juice, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, honey, and a little vinegar. it cooks down a bit until it's a little syrupy, then I spoon it over salmon fillets after searing them, then finish them in the oven. the sugar in the sauce caramelizes a bit in the oven and gives the fish a great flavor and color. since it contains no dairy or any product from meat (like some pan sauces that use fond from searing meat in the pan beforehand), it keeps very well in the fridge. besides the orange juice, pretty much all the ingredients are stored at room temp anyway. another i like to make is sort of a thai peanut sauce recipe that I modified a bit, and turned it into a mousse sort of- it goes great on top of things like fried rice or pad thai. coconut cream, peanut butter, handful of peanuts, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, brown sugar, tiny bit of sesame oil, blend on highest setting until it starts to become a mousse-like texture. a jar of that will keep in the fridge for weeks. in terms of other things that aren't sauces, I don't really do much prep further ahead than the same day I'm going to make the food.

My changes, off the top of my head, in no particular order: First, more beets, like 4-6 total. And I roast them in foil at 425 until they're tender while the meat is cooking. Not at all traditional, but it brings deeper flavor. Then peel and grate them in after the other vegetables have been added. Lemon juice from 1-2 lemons, to taste and depending on their size. Add some beef bones to the meat while it's boiling, then take them out. Makes the soup better. I use canned tomatoes. Just easier and tastier, unless they're in season. One 14-oz can with your choice of added seasonings, but I wouldn't use the Mexican flavor some stores have- wrong flavor profile. I add 1-3 tablespoons of \"better than boullion\" beef flavor. I know. I know. But it makes the soup taste like it's been cooking for days (in a good way). I try to make sure the ratio of liquid to meat and vegetables is such that it's more like a stew than a soup, but that's just because my eaters prefer borscht this way. Some fresh dill at the end of cooking- throw a few fronds in for about 5 minutes to simmer with the soup to add flavor, then pull them out so they don't get bitter. I do the same thing with the parsley. Add chopped to the bowls for serving.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1539708857}}

Dessert was a chocolate moelleux. I'm not a professional chef at all, but an amateur who can cook. But timing is crucial. If you can make things the night before, do so. Choose dishes that need little prep and don't keep you in the kitchen all night. Or if they need prep, do so the night before when the little one is asleep. I thought I was in way over my head with my menu.

It's so intense that it's really only useful if you think \"this should make me sweat\"; but for that, it is awesome and tastes good to boot. * Smoked chipotle powder -- this adds heat, but it also adds a great level of smokiness. * Cinnamon -- this can add an oft-overlooked depth and taste to richer dishes. * Nutritional yeast -- this isn't really a \"spice\", but it's also not a \"food\" or a condiment or whatever. I like it because it has a lot of benefits, particularly for vegans, and it adds a great cheesy and nutty taste. It's great sprinkled in or baked on medium-light foods. * Smoked paprika -- it adds smoky flavor and, while not spicy, can add a little bit of heat. Plus it has great flavor. Medium-light foods IMO. * Dill weed -- it makes something taste almost lighter, if that makes sense. It's great for lighter dishes.

Fat solidifies at a higher temperature than the water in muscle tissue, so leaner bacon will feel pliable while high fat bacon will be quite solid.** Also applies to other meats.

Unfortunately, you can't really determine the interior marbling with this method. I usually buy Kirkland Signature thick sliced center cut 2-pack (1.5lbs each). It's $10.99 (ish?) for 3lbs of totally decent bacon. It comes in a supposedly resealable zip-top bag, but I've never been able to open a package without destroying the zip top, so...not great on the packaging front. But good cheap bacon, and I can always pick up another lifetime supply of gallon zip bags while I'm at costco. When I'm not making a costco run, I always get bacon from the butcher counter rather than the bacon/sausage section of the meat case.

{"text":"Most of these are for butter crusts - which are great. Another option would be an oil crust - it's a very different texture from a butter crust, so you might want to make a trial run first. My FIL tries to avoid shortening and even much butter for health reasons, so I've learned to make this one for him. I like the oil crust fine for berry pies (prefer it for gooseberry, even), but I prefer shortening or butter for apple and lemon meringue. The oil crust can be flaky, but it's not going to have quite the lightness of the others, and it's better to use a little less dough and roll it thinner to mitigate that factor. I think I use something like 2c flour, 1t salt, 1/3-1/2c oil, 1/2-2/3c cold milk. Just mix the flour and salt, then pour in the milk and oil together and stir with a fork until it gathers, adding more oil or milk if necessary depending on the texture. Roll out as usual. It browns pretty quickly, so I usually bake around 360-375, and if it's a long-baking pie I'll put foil around the edges to prevent burning, and take the foil off for the last 10-15 minutes of baking.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1535841070}}

I would also invest in some carrots, onions, celery, sweet and spicy peppers, and garlic. Start every meal with those for flavor, and work from there. EDIT: Almost forgot acid! Pick up some citrus! Lemons are probably the most versatile, but if you prefer limes or something else, go with what you like.

Slowly pour the oil through the filter to get the majority of the particles out of it, then seal up the jar. Next time you're going to fry, dump that oil in the pan, and then add some NEW oil of the same kind (preferably) and start the heat. As it starts to warm up, but a wedge of potato in the oil.

{"text":"Just as an introduction to people who think they don't like tofu you should try Mapo Tofu...It's not exactly what you are asking for, but it fits in the same vein. It's one of my favorite dishes to make, and it's not only delicious but cheap and fast and a great gateway into what tofu can be. And yes there is meat... in it (there are also vegetarian/vegan adaptations but the dish isn't the same). But it's not really a meat dish, and it gives you that satisfying feeling you get from eating a bunch of meat, while only eating a little. I usually do 2 ounces of ground meat (pork is best, you want the fat) to 1 package of firm or extra firm silken tofu (silken is important!) . I've had the butcher ask why i want so little meat and even actually got him to try it himself. I eat way too much meat, most of us do. I wish I could eat less but it's satisfying, easy to cook, readily available (and never not ripe!), and really too cheap. (An aside, I sent my girlfriend to pick up some mushroom from safeway, and she got a package of 8 ounces, for 4 dollars, that's 8 dollars a pound for some fucking cremini mushrooms, there are so many meat options I can buy cheaper) But there are ways we can reduce our intake, and do better things for the planet, our taste buds, or even the animals (buying less of more expensive free range local meat from animals that had better lives than factory farmed meat). My real issue is just how hard it is to reduce my meat consumption at breakfast and lunch (I eat one or the other, along with dinner, so I usually am looking for something filling and satisfying). I can scramble up two eggs, throw a piece of ham with a slice of cheese in the toaster oven, throw two slices of bread in the toaster and have a really satisfying breakfast sandwich in around the same time it takes me to make a cup of coffee. I'm not into oatmeal or hot cereal (childhood trauma ;p), I do like granola, yogurt and fruit, but only if I can actually find ripe fruit. And it still isn't quite as satisfying. Anywhere I buy breakfast I can't remember the last time the vegetarian option appealed to me more than any of the normal ones. With lunch again, I can make a sandwich quickly, or buy one. I've tried some mozzerella tomato and basil sandwiches, but they are never good because the ingredients aren't fresh when you buy one, and you can't make one in the morning and not have it be soggy by lunchtime. When I go grab some tacos, kebab or a bahn mi again the veg options always seem more of an afterthought than anything. Or there just isn't the value on the menu, one deli where I used to live had a good eggplant sandwich, that cost just as much as a proscuitto brie and fig sandwich. Nothing against eggplant, but im taking the proscuitto brie and figs. As to straight up vegetarian, I'll do a coconut milk veggie curry with tofu (my curry paste probably has dried shrimp in it, but i know there are vegetarian alternatives). This chipotle miso tofu is also pretty damned good: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/07/grilled-tofu-chipotle-miso-recipe.html These Chayote squash tacos are so good you dont even think about meat when you eat them with some beans rice and grilled corn: https://www.rickbayless.com/roast-chayote-make-tacos-declare-victory/ Roasted butternut squash, carrot, onion, and mushroom enchiladas: Yea, that shit sounds great even if you were looking to eat meat. So many restaurants have blah vegetarian options, but this is something (similar) to what I ordered at a place because it sounded better than their meat dishes: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/12/enchiladas-suizas-rick-bayless-recipe.html I usually don't like vegetarian pastas, or well, I don't like vegetarian pastas with supermarket produce. It's never ripe enough, the flavors just don't pop. But if you've got a local market that has local food sources, or a farmers market there are a bunch of great pasta dishes you can make. The first is just a simple fresh tomato sauce with basil and olive oil. Best with fresh pasta, actually ripe tomatoes (two things money can't buy, love and actual vine ripened tomatoes) and good olive oil. :https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/anthony-bourdain/articles/spaghetti-with-fresh-tomato-sauce-and-basil but you can go all sorts of directions, get some fresh broad/fava beans, or some garden peas (also can throw either in a risotto). While we're talking italian pizza margherita is always great too.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1538376206}}

{"text":"This is the correct answer, but should probably be expanded upon. There are only 3 grades of beef in the USDA, Prime, Choice and Select. This is merely based on the fat content of the beef, it has nothing to do with how safe or well treated the meat is. The reason for the grading is more fat means better tastes. All meat that is sold in USA has been inspected, but not necessarily graded. All this means the meat the OP is finding in his supermarket has an unknown quantity of fat marbling. It is however perfectly safe to eat. On this point, you can visually inspect the fat marbling in the meat to get a good cut of meat. You probably won't be able to find a Prime steak in there, but choice and select are entirely possible.

Same thing with tofu, you have to add sauces to it, you cant just serve it as its own thing.

The sodium bicarbonate raises the pH in the pan and quickens the chemical reaction that turns the onions brown (it's actually not caramelization, but a non-enzymatic reaction between the sugar and amino-acids called maillard reaction.

{"text":"1. There's a lot of people who want this and are actively working towards breaking the code. 2. Indian restaurant workers are assimilating more and more by the year. Culturally, there's much less isolation. It's only a matter of time before one of them writes a blog or a book, or does a series of youtube videos. We've already seen some pretty good youtube clips on British gravies, CTM is very close. Pizzerias used to be run by Italian Americans who were very isolated and who guarded their recipes aggressively, but, eventually, that knowledge got leaked, and, now, we know just about everything there is to know about pizza. Indian restaurant food isn't that far behind. The biggest barrier, by a very very wide margin, is the common misconception that one of these seemingly countless recipes out there actually hits the mark. It's apathy that's holding us back. Bad CTM is a lot like bad pizza- it's still pretty good. The less people that settle, the faster we'll see results.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1551805022}}

{"text":"The main problem is that customers don't realize that by sacrificing their local stores to save a few cents, they are shifting their locally-earned income to a company that doesn't put the same amount of money back into the local economy. In fact, they go to the trouble of putting as little as possible back in by producing all of the products they sell in the countries that can do it for the least amount of money and paying their employees the bare minimum. Yes, it's a hassle to have to drive to a store that sells vegetables and then go to a store that sells screwdrivers, and it may cost less, but the people who check you out aren't taking the vast majority of the money you spent on either item and spending it at a store that *you* own, continuing the cycle of the local economy. It goes to the Walmart company, which will almost definitely not be buying whatever products are made in *your* town. So yes, it might be cheaper when you're on a tiny budget (I am right now), but sooner or later, your town won't be able to sell anything because either Walmart will sell it cheaper, or you won't be making enough money to buy it because no one is buying anything at *your* place of business. Walmart is the \"kingpin it is today\" because people don't have enough foresight to buy local, and then they complain that there aren't enough jobs, but it's because they're supporting companies that don't give a shit about anything but their quarterly statement, and will exploit anyone's instinct to buy the cheapest product even though it's not a sustainable business model. They'll be laughing their way to the bank, and by the time people realize that they can't even afford Walmart prices any more, Walmart will be able to pack up and go home. People are ignorant, and they're going to pay the price, but until they see the bill, it's not an issue for them. No, it's not that simple, but the people who shop at Walmart don't have the where-with-all to see the problem before it kicks them in the ass, and they aren't going to go to the trouble to find out.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1342399314"}}

{"text":"K. The person with Type 2 diabetes, unless s/he is a complete n00b and was just diagnosed yesterday, has a mental list of foods to avoid and foods to choose, and if presented with a normal menu of \"meat, starch, 2 veg\", can usually pick and choose the healthful options. Where the problems lie is in a menu that is carb-heavy, such as cracker canapes AND mashed potatoes AND stuffing AND baked yams AND baked beans AND dinner rolls AND your choice of cake or pie for dessert. The person sometimes feels obligated, because it's a holiday, to eat some of everything. Or sometimes they just like to eat it, and so they cheat, especially if they're new at the diabetes thing. So a lot depends on how well you know this person, and how familiar you are with their self-control. Are they the sort to be unable to say \"no\" to some of their dining options? If so, then it's not a kindness to load up the buffet with all kinds of stuff they shouldn't eat; stick to the turkey, its stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, a couple of cooked veg, a green salad, dinner rolls, and in addition to whatever dessert you want, include something sugar-free for a dessert, but not fruit, since fruit still counts as carbs, so isn't always the \"healthy\" option for diabetics. Your acid reflux person should similarly have a mental list of foods to avoid, and you're going to have to go through this list to see what not to serve. http://www.webmd.com/heartburn-gerd/features/heartburn-foods-to-avoid Wine is a problem for both of them. http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/ask-the-expert/ask-the-dietitian/archives/can-you-drink-red-wine-with.html","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1386468617"}}

As an experienced cook, I'll give you a quick rundown of foods that I keep on hand. **Pantry**: all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, honey, baking soda, baking powder, cornmeal, cocoa powder, dried beans (these vary, but usually include black beans, chickpeas, and lentils -- you can sub canned beans if you like), canned tomatoes, tomato paste, tuna, olive oil, grapeseed oil, salad vinegar (usually wine vinegar &amp; balsamic), grains (at least rice and oats, usually a few more), pasta (penne, spaghetti, couscous), tortillas (both corn and wheat), dried fruit, nuts (almonds, walnuts), peanut butter, hot sauce, onions, garlic, potatoes **Fridge:** maple syrup, mustard, mayonnaise, jam, olives, milk, eggs, butter, yeast, cheese (at least cheddar and parmesan), vegetables (these vary but I almost always have carrots, celery, bell peppers, broccoli, and salad greens on hand), fruits (seasonal, right now apples and grapes) **Freezer:** vegetables (peas, edamame, spinach, mixed vegetables), fruit (berries mostly), bone-in chicken breasts, fish (cod, tilapia, etc.), home-made chicken stock **Spices:** salt, pepper, cayenne, cinnamon, bay leaves, cloves, ginger, smoked paprika, cumin, cloves, nutmeg **In the outdoor herb garden:** basil, thyme, sage, marjoram, oregano, parsley, chives, rosemary Obviously, this is not all I keep around for preparing meals, but if you were to peruse my kitchen on any given day, you're pretty much guaranteed to find at least the above.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1509653982}}

{"text":"1.Do I need to reduce pan temperature? Is full heat going to be too much, or will full heat just affect the outer part instead of inside? Keep you Pan hot at first when you grill the skin then reduce it to medium. Just like GrandmaGos said you should then relax. Put a lid on your pan for about 2-3 minutes. Then flip/turn your salmon filet as your recipe says. 2.Frying pan or grill? Does it actually make a real difference, besides aesthetics? Frying pan is probably easiest. 3.Do I need to cover the salmon with a pan or aluminum foil? Keep it simple and use a lid 4.Many video's still say I should add salt and pepper to the salmon when I put it in the pan, I'm guessing some salt is always a bonus for taste? You can always add salt but you can never take away salt. You can tell your girl that you did not want to add salt because you were not sure how much she likes and then leave it up to her to add it. She will think you were being considerate and then you don't have to worry about whether or not you over did the salt. Now...here is my little gift of advice. If you filet is still too raw for your liking turn the heat of the pan on really high, grab 1/8 of a cup of water, and drop the water right into the pan and QUICKLY put the lid on the pan. It will steam the fish through the middle right away while keeping it very fresh and moist. Make sure that you turn off the heat at this point.

{"text":"Everyone will have different needs (obvious from the posts below). How comfortable are you with cooking? Do you enjoy cooking (if you do you will want more kitchen supplies) or do you cook just enough to get by? If you give us more info we can tailor our comments accordingly. That said I will offer up my suggestions as well. (Sorry for the length) Essentials: * Crock pot. - Get one. Seriously. MarkerBear made an excellent point about the amazing feeling of coming home to a warm meal. Plus you will almost always have left overs. If you are cooking for 1 or two a 4 quart crock pot should be enough, any more you might want to upgrade to a 6. * Two frying pans of different sizes - 8\" and 10\" are the most common, though you may want to shoot for a 12\" in case of company/large items. * 2-3 sauce pots. - small medium and large, preferably with lids. If you are on a budget start with the small and medium. * Cookie sheet - at least one. These are great for cookies, but also for any \"quick\" reheat of leftovers, oven nachos, pizza, etc. * Spoon, spatula, tongs- it's best if you have a couple, but at least have one of each. If you have non-stick pots make sure they are wooden or that heavy rubber. * 4 place settings - plates, cups, bowls, utensils. You don't want to have to wash dishes every day. * Pairing knife and a larger knife - These are my all time favorite pairing knives (http://www.amazon.com/Rada-Cutlery-Regular-Paring-Aluminum/dp/B000FZXB6U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378920414&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rada+paring+knife) * Cutting board Like others have said, get your salt and pepper, but then buy spices as you need them. You will learn which to buy in bulk as time goes on. Also buy oil, vinegar, flour, and sugar and keep on hand always. Nice to have: * Toaster Oven - These are great for a fast meal as they don't take so long to heat. * Extra place settings = not having to run the dishwasher as often/wash them by hand so soon * A variety of cooking utensils - same reason as above * Casserole pan * Drying mat - especially in the case of no dishwasher * Full knife set - most people list a chef's knife as essential, I didn't have one in college, and I survived without it, but they are nice to have. * Cast iron is amazing, but I wouldn't call it a \"college student\" requirement. * I also like to keep pasta and sauce, garlic, onions, and potatoes on hand. A great idea, like many have said, is to make extra food and freeze it. I also like to chop onions and potatoes and freeze them as well so prep time in cooking is faster. *Edit: Tried to fix formatting, ended up making it worse. Sorry!!!*","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1378920672"}}

Plus, you'll also pick up fundamentals of food prep and safety, knife skills and care, etc. to say the least. So yes, it has certainly helped me and I'd say it would you too. In terms of actually getting a job with that chunk of time, it really depends on the season you apply in (if the restaurant has seasonal spikes in business) and the quality of that restaurant. Most likely you'll have to either spend a chunk of time in the dish pit or at the bottom of the line before really getting the skills you're looking for. I worked my way up from the dish pit and was offered a spot on the second highest station on line in two summers, so it can certainly be done. My advice, apply everywhere you can ASAP. Chances are someone will want to pick you and have you trained up for the summer rush. **TL;DR:** Yes, it's worth it.

It's actually the way we do it at the restaurant I work at. We make a big batch of all the herbs, garlic and oil, season it, and then very finely dice some red onion and marinate it in red wine vinegar (to cover). When someone wants a side of chimichurri, we spoon some of the herb/oil mix into a bowl, and then add some of the onion/vinegar to taste. Keeping them separate this way is preferrable in a restaurant setting because without the acid, the herbs will stay green and bright for days, whereas if they were mixed with the acid they would turn color within the hour.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1531508545}}

{"text":"####Whole fish - Steamed in a banana leaf (or tinfoil) As promised to lacewingfly: *This is my favourite method of cooking a whole fish. I generally use snapper, but any white fish will work, it just needs to be a *reasonably* flat fish. The banana leaf can of course be substituted for tinfoil, but the flavour released from the leaf makes it worth it. The seasonings I am using here are for a ginger and garlic taste, but really you could use any asian seasonings (I've done this with thai green curry paste very successfully).* *This recipe is best cooked on a bbq (grill), but absolutely still delicious if cooked in the oven, so don't worry if you can only do indoor cooking, it'll still rock.* *As usual, all of my quantities are approximate. I eyeball ingredients and add more or less of certain things to my own personal taste, so they are a rough estimate. It seems like there are a lot of steps below, but they're all easy I promise.* OK here we go: ***What You'll need:*** * Whole snapper or similar, scaled, gutted, cleaned, spines removed. Your fishmonger will do this for you if you ask them nicely (if you do this yourself be very careful with the spines on a snapper, they are SHARP AS FUCK!) * Stalk of lemongrass * Spring onions (some for cooking, some for garnish) * Fresh garlic * Fresh ginger (I often advocate jars of minced garlic and ginger, but here fresher is better) * Light soy sauce * Kecap Manis (sweet soy sauce, should be easily available) * Mild Long green chilli (we don't want this to be too hot as it will over power the fish) * Juice of 1 lime * Some thai fish sauce * Some finely ground black pepper * A banana leaf (or two small ones, or a pandan leaf, or tinfoil if all else fails) ***What you need to do:*** 1. Start heating up your grill, bbq, or oven 1. Take your banana leaves and soak them in warm water to soften them up a bit and make them a bit more pliable. 1. Peel a thumb sized piece of ginger and slice as thin as humanly possible 1. Peel three cloves of garlic and do the same 1. Take the lemongrass stalk, peel off the outer leaves slice the white part of the stalk, again as thin as you possibly can, do the same with the chilli (use as much or as little as you prefer) 1. Chop two of your spring onions and slice them on the diagonal (these don't need to be too finely sliced) 1. Put all of this in a pestle and mortar and give it a bit of a bash! We aren't trying to make a paste here but a bit of a bruising to release the flavours of the woody ingredients like lemongrass and ginger. 1. Combine (approx) 1tbsp Kecap Manis, 1tbsp light soy sauce, 1/4 tsp fine ground pepper, 1tsp fish sauce, juice of half the lime. Now check the balance! Is it too salty? Add some more lime juice. Is it too sour? Add some more Kecap manis. lacking salt? Add some fish sauce. Balance it out and get it right, trust your palate. (as an aside I tend to keep this one a *little* on the salty side, but that's just my taste.) 1. Once you're happy with the balance of the seasoning sauce, add your ingredients that you have sitting in the pestle and mortar. 1. Give it a mix. Doesn't it smell awesome? It smells like holidays! 1. Grab your fish, and a sharp knife. Slash the fish right down to bone in a few places, both sides of the fish. 1. Put it on a plate and get that delicious sauce all over it! In the slashes you made, in the cavity, on the skin, everywhere! Reserve a little bit of the solids from the sauce. 1. I'm going to have to be a little vague with wrapping instruction I'm afaid, as it depends on the size and shape of your leaves and your fish. Take your Banana leaf and lay it out flat. You are going to want a double layer of banana leaf if you are going to cook over fire or direct heat. Place the fish onto it and pour the remaining sauce over it. 1. Now you need to wrap it. Do it whatever way you can. Use soaked bamboo skewers or soaked twine to secure it all tight (I personally find skewers the best method, thread them through like you are sewing) 1. Lower the heat on your grill, you don't want to burn the leaf badly. It can stand up to some heat but not a high grill. 1. Place the package on the heat and leave it alone. If your bbq has hood, close it. 1. Cooking time depends on the size of the fish. Use your judgement. For a fish big enough to feed two people I reckon it takes about 15 mins over a medium low heat. I'll have to leave this step up to you. 1. While the fish is cooking take two spring onions and slice them paper thin on the diagonal, or cut into matchsticks, these are your garnish (or you could use some coriander leaves if you like it) 1. Presentation time: use a scissors to cut the parcel open *at the table*. OMFG when your guests get that smell bursting out when you open the parcel they are likely to foodgasm. Sprinkle in the chopped spring onions. I usually serve this just with small bowls of good basmati rice sitting on plates, and some stir fried asian greens (bok choi, kai lan, choi sum, whatever) and let people help themselves to fish. I prefer this method of serving, it's a bit more social. 1. Drink lots of ice cold beer. 1. Eat lemon or mango sorbet for dessert. 1. Have fun! I'm always open to comments and constructive criticism, so feel free to tell me what you think. I think this could be greatly improved if served with coconut rice. Has anybody got any tried and tested recipes for coconut rice?","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1328909220"}}

{"text":"1) Although lengthy, seasoning with flaxseed oil is a mainly hands-off undertaking. We highly recommend the treatment: 1. Warm an unseasoned pan (either new or stripped of seasoning*) for 15 minutes in a 200-degree oven to open its pores. 2. Remove the pan from the oven. Place 1 tablespoon flaxseed oil in the pan and, using tongs, rub the oil into the surface with paper towels. With fresh paper towels, thoroughly wipe out the pan to remove excess oil. 3. Place the oiled pan upside down in a cold oven, then set the oven to its maximum baking temperature. Once the oven reaches its maximum temperature, heat the pan for one hour. Turn off the oven; cool the pan in the oven for at least two hours. 4. Repeat the process five more times, or until the pan develops a dark, semi-matte surface. *To strip a cast-iron pan of seasoning, spray it with oven cleaner, wait 30 minutes, wash with soapy water, and thoroughly wipe with paper towels.

My point is, don't say that what you're thinking is stupid, ever, (unless it's something that is obviously stupid, ever seen that guy who slams the milk jugs on the ground in the supermarket and breaks his jaw? That's fucking retarded). What you share with someone will last forever, even if they aren't physically here anymore, they will forever live on in that sense, even when you can move on (you will, trust me) and even after you die yourself. I don't want you to feel hopeless, or talking down to yourself, it will all get better, just know that you shared some very special moments with a very special someone, and that others care about you, even random internet dickheads like myself, and that is what will help you, be you.

My recommendation would be to butter and toast both slices of bread, put the avocado mix on the bottom slice, then the tilapia, drizzle a bit of lemon juice on top of the fish, sprinkle with dill and a pinch of salt and pepper, and add the top slice. That way you get the flavor of the avocado and peppers, but it won't overpower the seasoned fish or make the whole sandwich too \"mushy\" due to excessive avocado.

{"text":"Burritos are really easy. You can buy the wrappers pretty cheap - when you get more adventurous, they're really easy to make by hand as well. The filling we like is: * 1 T cooking oil * half dozen fresh roma tomatoes, chopped * 3 to 6 serrano chilies, diced - or even more if like us you live on the east coast where the available fresh chilies are so mild you can barely taste them. * 1 to 2 tsp minced garlic (or 1 to 2 cloves of fresh garlic put through a garlic press). The minced garlic in the grocery store is generally super-mild, I get better, stronger garlic either at Costco or from an ethnic grocery (pre-minced stuff in jars). * large onion, chopped coarsely * Bell pepper, chopped coarsely * 1 can of black beans, DRAINED * 1 tsp ground cumin * 2 tsp chili powder * shredded cheddar, asiago, monteray jack, asadero, queso blanco - or just buy some pre-shredded Kraft Mexican Mix * sour cream * cilantro, chopped Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet. Dump in the onions and SERRANO peppers and garlic, and stir the spice in with them. Cook over med to med high heat, stirring pretty constantly, until the onions are starting to soften - the edges will start to look translucent, but the centers will still be white. Dump in the BELL pepper and stir fry a couple more minutes. Now add the tomatoes. Stir fry a couple of minutes. Dump in the (drained) beans. Stir well and let cook down so the moisture cooks off. Just stir once in awhile to keep it from sticking/burning. Meanwhile, take 2 burrito wrappers per person, wrap in foil, place on the top rack of the oven, and turn the oven on to about 400F. They will be heated through in 5 mins or so. If your oven is one of the dumb ovens that turns the top element on while preheating, place the wrappers on the BOTTOM rack. Too close to the broiler and they'll turn hard and won't wrap. They make fairly tasty dipping-chips though. When the tomatoes are done, turn off the burner, take a wrapper, slap a spoonful of the above filling in the center. Top with cheese, sour cream, and a sprinkle of cilantro. Fold the bottom edge a couple inches up over the filling. Put a dab of sour cream on the flap. Fold the left edge over and put a dab of sour cream along that flap. Fold the final edge over top of that. The sour cream will make the burrito wrapper stick closed. Chow down. I know, it's meatless. If you must have meat, you can add some shredded or finely sliced cooked beef or some cooked chicken at the end with the beans. Grilled or blackened chicken is pretty tasty in a burrito. It's just easier to make it without, unless and until you get the whole basic cooking thing down.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1369390882"}}

I have two that I like to use: fuzzy fun time (tonka bean, vanilla extract and honeysuckle syrup) and dirty chai (roasted Assam tea, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger powder and a dash of soy sauce) * cocoa powder/coconut/ nut for rolling the truffle in Make sure everything at room temperature before you start. Beat the cream cheese with the powder sugar and your flavouring spices of choice until nice and fluffy (2 mins). Melt the chocolate in microwave/over bain-marie in a 20 s increment. Add the cream to make it easier to stir the chocolate if needed to. Pour the chocolate over the cream. stir until combined with a spatula.

Light grill and regulate temperature to 250 degrees. Add cherry and pecan wood for smoking. Once the smoke turns from white to light blue and is not billowing white, it is ready for the chili. 2. In the meantime, chop celery and onion until you have 3 cups of each. Finely chop the jalapeno and the poblano peppers. 3. Using an enameled dutch oven, saute in 1 tbsp vegetable oil until translucent. Mince 4 cloves of garlic and add to the mixture Saute this mixture for about a minute, then make a hole in the middle of the vegetables for the spices. This will give them some space to bloom. After spices have cooked in the oil for a few minutes, mix everything together and let cook for another minute. Add 1 cup of red wine and let this simmer for about 10 minutes to reduce. Then add tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, beef stock, beer, bloody mary mix, and pinto beans (optional). You can test for salt after this simmers for a few minutes. Bring this mixture to a slight boil, then let simmer. 4. Put the pot of chili on the grill indirect with an air gap under it. I rolled up 3 pieces of foil and set them under the pot so there was an air gap and it did not sit directly on the plate setter/heat deflector. This will prevent it from getting too hot and boiling over and the chili should have a slight simmer for the duration of the cook. 5. Prepare the ground beef by hand by rolling into an oval and dusting with salt and pepper. Place a rack over the chili, then the meat on top of the rack so it drips into the chili as it smokes. When the meat reaches 165 degrees internal temperature, the meat is ready to be broken up and added to the pot. Simmer for 20 more minutes and then serve hot with corn chips, cheddar cheese, sour cream and green onion.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1541862599}}

I throw them into a 9 x 13 pan drizzle with olive oil and also salt &amp; pepper. Roast at 400 in the oven for about 40 minutes, give or take. To change it up I sometimes add turnips cut into 1 inch pieces &amp; carrots. In addition to this, I generally do a 9 x 13 of zucchini, crook neck squash, and peppers. All these vegetables are relatively inexpensive and go a long way. My husband and I started doing this to make healthy lunches for work.

It has a long, slightly curved edge that allows you to chop like a santoku, but allows for the rocking motion like a chef's knife. The wide blade allows me to smash and scoop anything I want with ease. It also allows me to \"sight\" my cuts- by looking down the spine of my blade toward the edge, I can align it so that I know I'm cutting perfectly downward. The wide blade is also good for using the \"claw grip\" because you can always rest your knuckles against it. With a less wide blade, sometimes your knuckles can slip above the spine of the knife if you are cutting something tall. I also feel like it's safer. It doesn't have a sharp point (it does have corners, though) so there's no stabbing hazard. If I need to poke something, I have my paring knife on hand.

Kenji's method of getting rid of the water seems pretty cool... I think that'd be a worthwhile experiment for this dish. And your wok set-up is actually the ideal set-up for cooking outside of China, I think. Electric stoves would prove challenging and round-bottomed woks seem to really like that more intense heat source, but gas stove/flat-bottomed wok never really presented a problem to us when we were in the USA. So long as you're pre-heating the wok and doing the *longyau*, there's very few dishes that need extra consideration on a Western range. Just be sure not to crowd the wok and try to opt for the 'step-by-step' sort of stir-fry when you can (like we did here).","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1499816959}}

{"text":"Limeade! Or any dish usually calls for limes you can used the preserved ones instead. You just rinse the excess salt off and use as normal. With preserved limes you're getting a little more nuanced lime flavor, especially the kind from the peel. Or at least I think so, I've only done this with lemons a handful of times and that was my experience. But limes should be the same. I used mason jars and cut the lines into 8 wedges and layered them in tightly, sprinkling all kinds of coarse salt between layers. Like a quarter of a cup of salt for every 4 lemons or so. Pack it as tightly as you can and top with lime juice just so everything is covered. Then store them in the fridge like that for at least a week, flipping at the halfway point, and then for up to 3 months. For limeade syrup you mix 2 parts preserved limes to 1 part water and 1 part sugar, bring to a simmer until the sugar dissolves then cool for about an hour. Then stir on 1 part fresh lime juice. To serve you just pour some syrup into some water, or better yet sofa water. Vodka or gin would go great as well.

Anyway, we both realised that we had absolutely no idea WHY seeding works, and wanted to find out if it was actually necessary, so I went and found out on /r/askscience. Which you can see here. In conclusion seeding is the best method to use at home. Also, putting the shaped/block chocolate difference aside I don't think hershey's would make a good seed, becuase what they produce is very low quality.

{"text":"I find that mise en place makes more mess, not less. I grab all my ingredients and place them in a shopping bag to take into the kitchen from my stock, and I keep all my condiments and spices in easy plastic tubs in the kitchen. I tend to weigh everything into its respective pans, pots, trays, bowls, dishes straight away. Nearly every recipe I do is one pot, or one dish. Today my recipe is a pot, a dish and a bowl, a chopping board, a spoon, and a knife, that's it. This is a more complex recipe today, normally it would be less than this. A great thing to take ideas from is box skillet meals, don't eat them they are foul, but the idea of cooking a sauce, adding 2-3 cups of water then cooking the pasta in the pot (or rice or potatoes) is a great way to cut down on pots used. Normally this means all your washing up is all at once though, but use cutlery savers, we don't need to keep grabbing clean spoons to taste or stir.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1521389040}}

{"text":"The answer is most likely \"It Depends.\" Certain things need to cook for longer, but flavors change with the amount of heat and cooking time. What flavors do you want as \"core elements\" of the dish vs added ingredients? Let's take a look at the ingredients you mentioned and what changing the order would do to the dish. >Carrots, onion, broccoli cauliflower and gave that a few mins Three of those items take longer to cook down and lose their fibrous nature, so you're on the right track adding the carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower in early. But the onions could be moved around in the order. Do you want them to still retain their crunch and have a bite, or do you want the onion to be an underlying tone across the dish? If it's the latter, you could easily put the onions in first and sweat them until you get some browning and they start to release sugars. This will let a lot of their sulfurous components evaporate away and leave you with a milder dish, as well as flavoring your butter/oil so that everything in the dish has that same mild onion undertone. > Then the garlic and chili after These I might move up in the order. The chili flakes are dried, and take a bit of encouragement to release their flavor. Simmering them in oil will help tremendously, rather than simmering them on top of the broccoli. Some folks like an aggressive, raw garlic taste (and it fits with your kimchi), but you could also treat the garlic like the onion and get a much mellower \"body\" to the dish as a whole by moving it up. > then salt and pepper, bit of concentrated stock and kimchi No problems here, just a word of caution. You should usually salt as you go, but be wary of too much salt when cooking broth down. If the broth is salted, you may concentrate it to the point where you've over salted the dish. Just takes practice, and preferably homemade, unsalted stock. If I was making this dish, I would think that the Kimchi is going to be the star of the show and would want to keep that flavor as the most prominent element. So, I'd heat some oil to shimmering and toss in the pepper flakes for about 30 seconds before adding the onions. I might add the garlic first, but my electric stove isn't the best for temperature control, and I've over-cooked garlic very quickly before. I'd still get the browning I was after adding it with the onions, because I have a big pan (enough surface area) and I could control the heat with the mass of the onions cooling things down a bit. Once that's all had some time to get nice and friendly, and the onions have released a lot of their liquid, I'd add the other veggies. Then, deglaze the pan with the stock, scraping up all the good bits before adding the kimchi. Once that's heated through, I'd taste test for salt and pepper, then go with the noodles and serve it up. Really, just experiment with what you have on hand and see what happens. I often make notes on my instagram posts (yeah, I'm that guy) so I remember if I changed anything between cooking different recipes.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1526323282}}
{"text":"It is by far inferior in taste, texture, and nutrition. It's also ridiculously more expensive. (The cheapest way to buy rice is in bulk from Asian groceries; either Jasmine or Basmati is tastier than the American stuff, and a 20-lb. bag will often cost you no more than $10 and last you a year or more. Just keep it dry and bug-free and you're good.) Here is how you make basic, plain long-grain white rice of any variety (including jasmine or basmati) on a stovetop. Read the entire instructions before you start or I will not guarantee success. It's actually ridiculously simple, but there are various factors it's important to take into account. The easy version: put 1 part rice, 2 parts water into a pot, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, cook 15 minutes, remove from heat and leave to stand, covered, for 10 more minutes. That's all. The clueless person version: 1. Get out a pot that has a lid and will hold 50-100% more than the volume of rice and water you're putting into it. Otherwise your pot will overflow when the water boils. I recommend nonstick pots for rice, and ONLY for rice, because if you burn rice any other pan will be a writeoff. 2. Measure out the rice. A typical serving is between 1/4 cup and 1/3 cup per person. You're measuring by volume so what type of container you use makes no difference. *If you don't like your rice sticky, rinse the rice thoroughly before cooking it. You will be removing most of the remaining nutrition in the process, but that's your choice. *If you are making basmati rice, you can rinse and then soak it in cold water for 20-30 minutes and then drain before cooking. The grains will lengthen but otherwise the cooking process is the same. *If you expect each grain of rice to come out perfectly separate, you are a philistine and you can ignore these instructions and cook your rice like pasta in a big pot of boiling water, you prissy pantywaist. 3. Put your rice, whether dry or drained, into the pot. Using *the same measuring container*, add exactly twice as much water. Again, you are measuring volume. Volume is all that matters. 4. Place the pot on a burner and turn it up as high as it will go. PAY ATTENTION. Small quantities will boil very quickly. Give it a stir or two to prevent it all from sticking to the bottom of the pan. 5. As soon as the rice comes to a full, rolling boil (and NOT BEFORE), put the lid on the pot and turn the heat down very low. How low depends on your stove. If it heats really well, go straight to minimum. If it's a wimpy stove, go to the 2nd lowest setting. If you're using a gas stove, you may need to use a heat diffuser for optimal results. 6. Set a timer for 15 minutes. If you're using an electric stove, you may need to watch the rice for another minute or two, just to make sure it doesn't return to boiling; if it does, lift the lid until it stops boiling and then replace it. Once you're sure it's not going to boil over, walk away. Resist the urge to fuss. DO NOT remove the lid again until I say so. 7. When the timer goes off, remove the pot from the heat. Leave the lid on. Allow to stand for 10 more minutes. Congratulations, your rice is done. You may now remove the lid.

If you pre chop everything and salt and pound your chicken cutlets ahead of time, there shouldn't be too much to do as far as the cooking goes. Just brown your components and throw in your marsala mixture. For the risotto, it should be as simple as browning your veggies, throwing in the rice, throwing in the broth, and waiting til done to throw in cheese and cream.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1556052830}}
{"text":"Some tips from a fellow carnivore: Chickpeas have that satisfying feeling in your stomach. Add spices, onions, tomato etc and they can easily make a really good main dish. Slow-sauteed mushrooms with garlic and spinach wilted down in the last minutes tastes amazingly \"meaty\". A mainly veggie dish, but with a couple of rashers of bacon (We use english bacon) chopped up and cooked with it makes it 90% veggies, but very tasty and satisfying. There's something about roasted cauliflower with cumin that is very meatish. Very nice side. Most importantly, experiment. I know it's hard when you're cooking for just yourself, but it's the best time to experiment with different dishes because no-one will suffer except yourself. Enjoy experimenting. You don't need to make \"veggie\" dishes, but experiment with how little meat you can include in a dish and still make it delicious.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1544044001}}

{"text":"You misunderstand. The only thing fried in oil is the garlic. Here is Bayless's recipe. Other than sorting the beans, OP's first real cooking step is \"put the onion and garlic in for a minute, until aromatic.\" Bayless's first steps are to \"heat the oil\" and \"Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant but not brown.\" He even mentions that \"Some [cooks] brown a handful of chopped onion before adding the garlic.\" OP's next step is to add dry beans and \"enough [water] to well cover the beans,\" whereas Bayless adds \"home-cooked beans with just enough cooking liquid to cover.\" So OP is just cooking the beans at the same time as the rest of the stuff. OP adds the hock and some jalapeno, but that's not that huge of a deal. Both then simmer for a while. OP naturally cooks longer because the beans were raw to start with. At the end, OP says \"get thee a masher, and mash until its a consistency you like.\" Bayless says \"coarsely mash them\" and \"How smoothly you mash them is entirely a matter of personal preference.\" Bayless also adds a final step to cook them down a bit more. Again, not a big difference, and Bayless never \"fries\" the beans -- the recipes are essentially identical. So again, to everyone here lecturing OP about what \"refried beans\" are, you should really pay Bayless a visit next time you're in Chicago, and tell him he's doing it all wrong, too.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1379082469"}}

{"text":"Yes. It's the practical application of thermodynamic principals as applied to meat. Primary difference will be that pork chops are quite a bit leaner than the typically beef steak you'd use in a similar dish, but the technique is the same. That said, it's probably not necessary. Reverse sear is almost required with thicker cuts of beef steak, if you want an even level of rareness. Also with beef, you have a lot more intramuscular fat than with pork, and rendering that fat really helps with the flavor of the beef. With pork chops, I wouldn't normally go quite as thick unless they're stuffed, and then I just roast those as extra handling just results in the stuffing getting all over.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1525966407}}

{"text":"Only if you promise to let me know how you liked it :) Make sure you pop the ice cream attachment and the beater blade for it in the coldest part of your freezer for at least a day in advance for best results. Ingredients: * 1 Tbsp Cocoa Powder * 1 Cup Heavy Cream * 3 Cups Half and Half * 8 Egg Yolks * 9 Ounces Sugar * 2 Tsp Vanilla * 7 Ounces Milk Chocolate 1. In saucepan over medium heat, mix cocoa powder with 1 cup of half and half cream. Combine fully (no cocoa powder chunks!) and and the remaining half and half as well as the heavy cream. Bring to a simmer 2. Whisk the egg yolks until they are lighter in colour, then gradually add the sugar. 3. Slowly add 1/3 of the simmering cream mixture to the egg mixture, whisking constantly (this tempers the egg mixture). Once you've combined them thoroughly, pour this mix back into the saucepan on low heat. Whisk to combine. 4. Cook this mixture, stirring often, until it reaches 170\u00b0-175\u00b0 F. 5. Stir in vanilla and chocolate, then set aside until it reaches room temperature. (You should totally taste it now. This is a preview of the nirvana you will enjoy shortly.) 6. Refrigerate the mixture until it reaches 40\u00b0 F, then pop it in the kitchenaid ice cream maker and let it do it's thing. Make sure you turn the mixer on *before* you add the ice cream batter to it, or it won't churn as well. I like to shave some dark chocolate (or a white kit kat bar) and add it to the ice cream a minute or two before it comes out. When your kitchenaid starts clicking as it turns, your ice cream is pretty much done. Serve immediately if you ~~have no self control~~ like soft serve, or let it sit covered in the freezer for a few hours for a firmer texture. This ice cream is so silky smooth and rich - I hope you enjoy it! We also really like to add Bailey's, orange liqueur, chopped frozen berries, and toasted coconut flakes (not all together, of course - that would be madness!)

{"text":"Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to do 180 new recipes, but take it from this old home cook, I've spent my entire adult life in the kitchen, and a program like this one can do more harm than good. If you only train one part of your palate (and that's all a single exercise like cooking is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for cholesterol down the road. I've seen it a hundred times. It's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel. What will you accomplish? You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine. Cooking basically only trains the stomach and to some extent, the small intestine. What you really want to do is train your entire body, all the major gastro groups (large intestine, liver, tastebuds) at the same time, over the course of a meal. And don't forget your dessert work! I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with food, eating a lot, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make. But do it right, okay? My advice, find a good restaurant, with qualified chefs who will design your meal for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for yummy tendies. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is). And don't worry about being embarrassed or being in shape the first time you walk into the restaurant. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway. Now get out there and do it! :-)","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1550006177}}

I usually use less sugar than most frosting/icing recipes call for because of personal taste. So for me too sugary or not sugary enough could be totally different than someone else. When butter is taken out to soften, at room temperature it gets super creamy and with a little more heat will begin to melt. Put that butter back in the fridge and it stiffens up nicely again. So that hard icing property will come from the icing but you can also use a drop or two of corn syrup if you'd like. It'll lend towards smoothing it out and adding a glossy like sheen that's nice. Hard to find organic corn syrup sometimes though and I couldn't in my right mind recommend a corn syrup that isn't. Rather go without in that case. The cream cheese is nice.

{"text":"Not at all a stupid question. Actually, it's a really interesting one that I could go on about at length. [After writing my comment, I look back and see that I do go on at length...] Essentially, it depends on what you want out of a pizza, or rather, what your idea of pizza is. It also depends on what your idea of tomato sauce is. As an American who grew up in Philadelphia in an Italian-American family, we ate a lot of \"gravy\" when I was younger. I don't know the secrets that went into the gravy that my grandmother and great aunts made, but I do know how my dad made it - lots of sausage, meatballs, and some other meat simmered for a long time in tomato sauce that is flavored with garlic and onion. Often there would be dried basil incorporated into this as well. This is what I think of as the quintessential version of \"spaghetti sauce\" in America - tomato, garlic/onion, meat, and long simmering. This sauce is meaningful to me, and it is delicious, but the way I think of Italian sauces these days is quite different. That Italian-American sauce came about via my Italian immigrant ancestors memories of their own Italian ancestors. It is an American memory of the old world that has become enshrined in the minds of many Americans as \"tomato sauce.\" So many people think of a tomato sauce as something that needs long simmering, always contains onion/garlic, and very often contains meat. If you look at Italian tomato sauces, however, this is not the case. There are many many tomato sauces for pasta in Italy. The one that is closest to the Italian-American version is probably Ragu Neapolitano, which contains beef and/or pork, onions, garlic, and long simmered tomatoes. But other sauces, like Marinara do not contain meat or onions and are cooked rapidly, creating a fresh tasting, bright red sauce with most of the natural acidity of the tomatoes intact. Marinara, as the name applies, is a sauce made by and for mariners and is great in a meal to complement oily fish like bluefish - you need that acidity to balance out the richness of the fish, and the brightness of the sauce is there to match a sunny, clear day by the water. It's a summery sauce that is light and is used for those occasions, whereas something like Ragu Neapolitano or Italian-American gravy is a heavier sauce that is better for cooler days or when you want to incorporate a big plate of meat into your table. So tomato sauces vary quite a bit and are made to suit the occasion, whether you want a lighter, brighter sauce or a richer, meatier sauce and everything in between. Now onto the pizza. I prefer thin crust, a bright tomato sauce, a relatively small amount of fresh mozz, and I go light on the toppings. I often top the pizza with a few olives or pickled peppadew peppers, and hit it with aged cheese and a few handfuls of arugula when it comes out of the oven. I might add some slices of soppressata when comes out of the oven as well. The toppings are just supporting characters; the essence of the pizza is a balance between crispy, chewy crust, bright tomato sauce, and a little richness form the cheese. If the sauce is too heavy and concentrated by being cooked down and having things like anchovy/Maggi/Worcestershire sauce or the sweetness of onions added to it, the sauce will be too rich to fulfill its function and the pizza will be out of balance for me. Now I say \"for me\" here purposefully, because a balanced pizza to me is a basic expression of bread, relatively unadorned tomato, and fresh cheese. It's straightforward and there's a clarity to it. That is not be everyone's vision of what pizza is, and typical American style pizza isn't about clarity and balance. The kind of pizza you will get 3/4 of the time if you randomly call a pizza place in most parts of the US will be balanced towards richness. It's frontloaded with sweetness from onions, concentrated by long cooking, and complicated with the addition of oregano and other seasonings. It resembles, to me, Italian-American tomato gravy in spirit - heavy and rich with an impression of abundance. This rich sauce is then combined with a fluffier dough that is often enriched with olive oil, milk, and even sugar sometimes whereas in contrast my dough is just a simple mixture of 500g flour, 375ml water, 14g salt, and a teaspoon of yeast. On top of that enriched dough there is a rich sauce, and on top of that rich sauce, there is rich, low moisture mozzarella cheese. And that is just before even more richness is added from toppings. I could go on, but I hope my point is made that there are two broad directions you can take with pizza - one with more balance between the elements that favors lightness, and one that is balanced toward richness. If you're going for the light version, which I prefer, then you don't want to overcook the sauce so as to retain the acidity of your tomatoes. If you're going for the richer version, you want to cook the sauce down so that you extract the maximum sweetness out of the onions, reduce the acidity of the sauce, and concentrate and thicken your tomatoes. It's all just a matter of style and preference. All pizza can be good pizza; the key is knowing what you're going for and executing. For many, cooked tomato sauce is the sauce of their memories and it's what they prefer. Whenever I'm cooking, I'm playing along with these memories - sometimes I play with them, sometimes against but they're always there and they shape how I think about what I'm making since what I'm making is an expression of my history, philosophy, and leads me into an unknown future - who knows what kind of pizza I'll be making in ten years? It will surely be different than what I do now. I'll be interested to see where it goes.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1464274656}}

{"text":"*1. Android app** http://www.pepperplate.com is amazing. It's free, the desktop version syncs with mobiles and tablets, and you can scale recipes up and down. It's also super easy to add recipes you find: on some sites they even import automatically at a single button click. Otherwise you cut and paste and it formats everything for you. **2. Out of date vegetables** Some vegetables last ages in the fridge, eg carrots. Salad greens don't do so well. Even if carrots get a bit withered they're still great for stews (after all, our ancestors stored vegetables all winters). I personally find frozen veg has an odd taste, but frozen sweetcorn is great. **3. Quick meals** Here are three super quick and easy meals that you can make from long-lasting pantry ingredients, including frozen chicken pieces: * Italian Pasta &amp; Bean Stew - lasts a week in the fridge. Ignore the bean-soaking stuff, I just use canned. Base recipe is a little bland, I would add paprika and chorizo (but some kids prefer bland so it's useful if that's the case). You can skip the spinach if you don't have any to hand, and you could get away without the celery if you needed as well (so just beans, onions, pasta, bacon). * Crockpot Peanut Chicken - the only slow cooker recipe I have found that has the perfect, thick sauce after cooking. Serve with anything you like, even just bread, and you can skip the fresh herbs. * Smokey beans - I'm not even going to link to a recipe as this one is so easy. Chop and soften-fry an onion. Add a can of tomatoes and a can of beans (any kind: chickpeas even, if you like. Cannellini are great). Add a couple of tablespoons of BBQ sauce. That's it. You can add whatever else you like to it: chopped up capsicum peppers, carrot, sweetcorn, chopped herbs, chopped sausage/chorizo, bacon. Whatever else you have spare. But the basic beans/onions/tomatos are fine, and great with crusty bread. **4. Storage** You can store nearly everything longer than it says. You can also freeze milk. Old/tired vegetables can be used for a stew, no one will notice (their nutritional value may be a bit degraded, but they won't be harmful). Store dried herbs and spices in the fridge if you can. If space is an issue, buy mixes. \"Moroccan spice\" blend instead of separate cumin, coriander, ginger, etc. \"Mixed herbs\" will go with everything from French to Italian, pasta, pizza, stews. Soy sauce is a great way to add a bit of flavour to things and lasts for ages.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1432872701"}}

{"text":"Hello Daniel, How are you thinking schedule wise? Cause with a busy schedule I'm imagining you'd be streaming anywhere from 1-3 days of the week cause it takes a lot of energy to put on a show as well by yourself. Also what everyone else has touched on, content. If you have demands and a list of dishes you want to do each stream (each streaming being 1 dish at a minimal basis), it wouldn't be a bad idea. Cause a 3-4 hour typical stream would require a lot of energy but having an established schedule with a consistent starting time, a 40minute to an hour and a half making simple home ingredient or spiced up refined dishes would be a good start. Depends on your schedule too which I'm sure you more than myself have considered without me telling you :D. Under the 'Creative' category of Twitch, there's a large variety of what people stream (varying from forging metal, carving wood, digital paintings, etc.) and personally for me its just the chill environment that the broadcaster can put on that makes it worth watching, not so much the content priority wise at first. As some have already mentioned, if you are able to be entertaining by yourself for a period of time, the content will only be a bonus added on top. But I think by your statements, the act of sharing your ideas and knowledge to others will be a great way for you to rekindle that enthusiasm, and it will show it to the viewers. I love cooking and I would love to see a variety of dishes ranging technicality wise and also touching on your home roots of cultural palettes. I don't see too many cooking streamers (I use twitch) so this is something I would be down provided the broadcaster (you) can establish that chill learning environment :) it sure as hell not gonna be easy, cause with cooking I imagine you would need some production value which doesn't come cheap. Simple camera or multiple (for angles), some extra lightning (if the room lightning isn't sufficient), a mic, but that's just me with my standards of production value. You can get a lot done with a webcam and its built in mic so don't worry too much on that at first, sorry. Content comes first, then the production value and consistency of the stream. 1 final note is that establishing yourself as a streamer from the get go is gonna be hard at first because its something you have to be consistent with. A good idea is to archive it online like on Youtube and redirect them to your streams. Or even both, or just one. Both platforms have their pros and cons but streaming at the start is going to be tough. If you can get the snowball effect going, all to ya :)","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1449183956}}

{"text":"My SO and I have been experimenting for a while with pizza recipes and now I think we have the perfect one. Here's what we found makes an awesome pie: 1. crust. Find a recipe that requires multiple folding and resting cycles (2 or 3). I've tried those recipes that only need an hour to rise and then go right into the oven and it just doesn't allow enough time for flavor to develop. Our usual recipe takes 12 hours total but a lot of that is wait time so it's not so bad 2. sauce. 1 can san marzano tomatoes, salt, pepper, olive oil, basil (optional). just crush it all together. Drain tomatoes first for chunky sauce. Simple and delicious and so easy. 3. cheese. I like a mixture of mozz, parmesean, and asiago. Mozz is a super mild flavor so experiment with mixing some other cheeses with it. 4. some people have also mentioned higher temperature. We use 550 bc it's the highest our oven will go. If your oven doesn't get hot enough (or even if it does) you can broil it for the last 2 minutes of baking to get the cheese to brown slightly which is super yummy Good luck on your pizza endeavor!","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1459348925}}

{"text":"The finger test is not a good way to tell when your meat is done. Use an instant-read digital thermometer instead. You do not need to (and should not) bring your meat to room temperature before you cook it. Leaving it on the counter for 30 minutes will not appreciably raise the internal temperature of the meat and will bring the outside of the meat into the danger zone for bacteria growth. How much/when to flip/move your meat is dependent on a number of factors such as patty thickness and your goal for the burger, e.g. maximize browning vs. maximizing amount of medium rare beef. There is no one size fits all answer. Heat distribution in a pan is more a function of the material of a pan as well as time. However, pans with thicker bottoms are able to maintain their temperature better when food is added compared to thin bottomed pans which is useful when cooking burgers.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1530283501}}

I am sure learning to cook to feed yourself, or to accumulate skills has value, but I don't see that keeping anyone's interest for very long. You may stop cooking before you reach proficiency at anything.

{"text":"I'm not trying to pick apart your technique, but artisan pizza has been an obsession of my over the last few years and I think that I can offer some suggestions which may help even further improve your pizza, if you're interested. If nothing else, this may be a brain dump for anyone interested. Rising bread in the oven is a no-no; rising shouldn't happen in environments above 80F and it will likely dry out the outside of the dough at that temp. Slow ferment=flavor. Most people these days actually prefer a slow ferment in the fridge for ~12-24h. I like to then let it sit on the counter for ~3 hours after fridge ferment that before shaping, but some people say only 45m-1h is necessary. Also, you don't need pizza dough to double in size. Most bread bakers actually say it's not about volume increase, but the feel that lets you know when your bread is ready. If you're hand kneading you can knead for 45 minutes, but its pretty easy to overknead with a mixer. I prefer the romantic nature of working with my hands with the dough, so I really can't comment much on automatic kneading. I just took a bread class from some crazy French guy that makes amazing bread, though, and he says he recommends no more than ~10 minutes on the mixer. If you're working with wet dough, this French Fold technique is great (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvdtUR-XTG0) and the secret is to pull it off the counter real quick. Quick sharp movements. I've never had good luck with the broiler. I have a gas stove, though, so my broiler doesnt seem to get as hot. I can get a stone to ~660F without any oven tricks. I like to be at around 730-750 since I prefer a Neapolitan style. Sometimes I'll throw a frozen washcloth on the oven's thermometer to get into the temperature I like to bake at, though you need to remember to take that off when you're done (true story). Google 'Little Black Egg' (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtXTMufUMh0) if you are interested in an affordable outdoor pizza oven (this may be a summer project for me) capable of getting into Neapolitan temps. If I could boil down my beginner mistakes, they would be: * Measure ingredients out on a scale. Measuring flour by volume is too inaccurate. * Don't fear wet dough, and don't reach for flour when it is too wet. Trust the hydration ratio when you're starting out. Kneading will transform the gluten into something workable. The more flour you add, the more uniform your dough is going to become. 60% is a good place where it is manageable, yet still rewarding. * Preheat the stone for 1+ hour. Get that sucker hoooooot. Verify temp with an IR thermometer. The hotter you get it , the more open crumb (big flavorful holes) you get because you get better oven spring. * Use sauce and toppings minimally, or deal with your pizza sticking to your peel. * Work fast while preparing the pizza with toppings. I usually have it sauced, topped, and in the oven in about 60s from transferring the naked shaped dough onto the peel. Every 15s I'm shaking the peel to make sure nothing is sticking. Making pizza (Napels style, at least) may be one of the hardest things to do properly in the kitchen. It's quite an art form, and takes quite a bit of practice. The good pizza makers seem to make pizza almost once a week at home. Varsano's site helped me tremendously when I was getting started: http://varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm And I always pick up little things here and there from pizzamaking.com.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1326769916"}}

That helps you save money by knowing you're going to use everything, and it stops you from aimlessly wandering around the mart putting things in your cart.

{"text":"NYT: Cilantro Haters, It\u2019s Not Your Fault By HAROLD McGEE Modern cilantrophobes tend to describe the offending flavor as soapy rather than buggy. I don\u2019t hate cilantro, but it does sometimes remind me of hand lotion. Each of these associations turns out to make good chemical sense. Flavor chemists have found that cilantro aroma is created by a half-dozen or so substances, and most of these are modified fragments of fat molecules called aldehydes. The same or similar aldehydes are also found in soaps and lotions and the bug family of insects. Soaps are made by fragmenting fat molecules with strongly alkaline lye or its equivalent, and aldehydes are a byproduct of this process, as they are when oxygen in the air attacks the fats and oils in cosmetics. And many bugs make strong-smelling, aldehyde-rich body fluids to attract or repel other creatures. The published studies of cilantro aroma describe individual aldehydes as having both cilantrolike and soapy qualities. Several flavor chemists told me in e-mail messages that they smell a soapy note in the whole herb as well, but still find its aroma fresh and pleasant. So the cilantro aldehydes are olfactory Jekyll-and-Hydes. Why is it only the evil, soapy side that shows up for cilantrophobes, and not the charming one?","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1394663984"}}

When the slow cooker is done after 4-6 hours on high, shred the chicken into the remaining salsa compote and you have fantastic chicken tacos with rice and beans on the side.

Melt butter in large saucepan on low heat. Whisk in flour, stirring until smooth. Gradually stir/whisk in milk, slowly so you don't get clumps. Heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil and is thickened. Remove from heat. Stir in salt, w sauce and cheese, until cheese melts. Add macaroni and mix well. Put in a greased 3 litre casserole. Bake at 375F for 30 minutes or until hot and bubbly. Don't let it sit too long after that or it goes a bit stoggy. Makes 6 servings. .

{"text":"I like my \"oatmeal\" made with \u00bd steel cut oat and \u00bd kasha, aka roasted buckwheat. The difference between steel cut and rolled oats is that the former has texture and flavor and adding buckwheat gives it even more of both. Generally 1 part grain to 4 parts water. I cook for myself and one serving is \u00bc cup grain to 1 cup liquid, but use common sense. For instance, If you're adding a whole banana out of the freezer use less water because there's a lot of liquid in the banana. If you're adding dried blueberries or dried tart cherries use more water cause the dried fruit will absorb water. For sweet oats, I add 1 teaspoon sweetener per serving, usually brown sugar, maple syrup, or honey; usually toss in a teaspoon of cinnamon too. If I'm making savory ~~porridge~~ oatmeal I brown the sausage and saut\u00e9 the onions, garlic, and hot peppers first. I use a double boiler because there is no chance of burning and I don't have to watch it or even stir. Just set a timer for 40 minutes and forget it. I don't have a double boiler so what I mean is I put a good quart of water in a 1.5 qt. pot and put the oats in a covered 3-quart mixing bowl on top of the pot.

{"text":"$430 a month on food is a nice budget for one person, including snacks and so forth - but you need to learn to work with leftovers. Either enjoying them as leftovers or learning to reuse them. Some of my standard meals during the course of a week include a whole roasted chicken (roasted chicken and veg the first night, then sandwiches for lunch, then maybe chicken tacos or chicken enchiladas the next night [with leftovers of that for the next lunch], then make stock from the carcass for using in other meals. I also do a lot of big pots of soup, stew, or chili that can be either eaten on for a couple of days or you can make double or triple batches of some things and then freeze them for later in the week or month (keeps me from getting tired of the same thing over and over). And I have to admit for a fondness for old-fashioned tuna noodle casserole (with homemade mushroom sauce) with frozen veggies in it. It also serves well for a couple of meals at a minimum and some leftovers you can freeze and nuke for later. Being willing to do a few veggie or low meat meals will help keep costs down as well. Make a pot of beans and rice or a veggie stir fry (or one with very little meat added). Breakfast for dinner can be cheap and really delicious, too. Speaking of breakfast, get away from cereal since it's expensive. I love steel cut oats in the winter - they're a little more expensive up front, but a 1/4 cup expands in a cup of water to make a nice serving, and when topped with cut up fruit, it's a good bit of food. Or mix oats with a little cheese and top with a fried or poached egg for a savory version. One thing I do that saves money is wait until chicken breasts go on sale for some ridiculously low price. Then I'll buy a bunch and poach them in water that has a big scoop of taco seasoning in it. Shred them and then freeze them in 2 serving packets. That chicken can be used in enchiladas, tacos, nachos, any type of Mexican dish you want, and it's pre-cooked and ready to go. Avoid prepackaged snacks and things that are in \"single serving\" sizes. They actually wind up costing more per serving. Obviously don't buy in bulk if you don't have a way to freeze/preserve things, but there's a balance between the two. I think on your budget you could have some great meals. Good luck.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1449018865}}

By way of example, I offer quartered artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, capers and sliced scallions as 4 separate topping options, because I make a killer salad with those ingredients and can just store them together after the party for a day or two until I can fit the salad into my regular rotation. Chopped fried bacon is another topping I always offer, because I know that in any given meal, I can put leftovers to good use; the same is true of whole garlic cloves roasted in olive oil. ... and use fresh mushrooms, sliced and sauteed until lightly brown in olive oil or butter as to your taste.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1517020786}}

A friend of my wife's was staying with her mom at that point, and they had a couple extra bedrooms so they invited us to stay instead of trying to find a hotel. To repay the kindness, I offered to cook a nice dinner, figuring that they haven't had someone cook for them in quite a while and wanting to repay them for hosting us. Finding dishes and utensils wasn't so bad. However, I pulled out a hot dish of chicken parm from the oven, and unfortunately I picked an oven mitt that didn't have adequate protection. And the oven was more than a few steps from the table. And all the countertops were cold granite, no trivets in sight. The only way to not launch the hot af dish, or put it on a cold granite counter (likely shattering the dish and ruining the chicken due to thermal shock) was to grab it with my other bare hand.

Crepes are very delicate and worn spatula will definitely catch. What you can do to make it easier is first get the corner of the spatula like 1/2\" under the edge of the crepe and just follow the outside of the pan lifting that corner. If you wait till they are a bit more cooked, this becomes easier. Once you've done that shake the the pan to and away from you quickly - or side to side - to get the crepe loose. Tilt the pan forward and let the crepe slide a bit to one side. This should make it a lot easier to work the spatula under it. If that fails try this: get corner of spatula under the the crepe, then with your finger gently lift the crepe a bit and work the spatula under a bit more. Don't burn your finger, so do this in like 3 - 4 steps but you should be able to get all the way under it.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1347281468"}}

Probably the best chicken I've had cooked in under an hour! I will probably stay with Heston's approach as it gives more control (you can set the internal vs external temperatures/crispiness separately) and works for all size birds, even though it takes a lot longer - I would urge you to give it a go, and definitely brine your chickens beforehand!

Making real pho broth takes many hours and many ingredients, its best done in large batches due to the cost and effort, but for a home cook, that sucks. Other than the broth, getting the noodles, veggies, meats/tendon/meatballs/tripe, and sauces is easy, but without the real broth its not quite the same However, one workaround... chicken pho! Just use low sodium chicken broth as your base, and put together your pho ingredients to your liking, and have it that way. Yes chicken pho is a normal traditional dish too, though personally, i do prefer the beef.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1470370144}}

I have a few favorite websites and cookbooks that I consult. Sometimes I'll even just open a cookbook to a random page and make that, because I do like trying to make new things. I also have started a list though of recipes that my husband and I both really enjoyed,so I can consult that list if I want a meal I know we both love. The list only has about 15 recipes on it so far but I'm slowly adding to it sorts becoming a better and better resource. Last, I make a lot of stir fry to use up leftovers. If there's any leftover meat or vegetables, I saut\u00e9 them with onions and galic in vegetable oil and sesame oil, then add some salt, pepper, soy sauce and rice vinegar, then add some cooked rice.

Ground meat, due to the fact that its all ground up and mixed up, has a much much higher chance of developing harmful bacteria growth than steak. Steak is going to have the surface of the meat under very high temps, which will effectively sterilize it. Don't forget, \"aged\" beef can sit for 30 days more or less before cooking.

{"text":"I was a line cook/sous chef for 14 years. I definitely developed some philosophical points about cooking; maybe not an outright philosophy. Basically, I realized that we do not cook and eat for one consistent reason, but for many, and that realizing this really removes a lot of the bullshit around cooking and eating: To sustain: this is why there is canned tomato sauce in the world. Sometimes, you just need to not die. For nostalgia: this is why you still use grandma's pizzelle recipe, even if it isn't the best. It's that specific taste. We eat like this to remember. To enjoy the taste: this is why you spend half your paycheck on one dinner at home for you and the Mrs. The foie, the saffron, the artisan cheese plate... this is the sensual type of cooking and eating. To enjoy the process: can I make a better brioche than the bakery 4 blocks from me? No. Does the pleasure I get from making the starter, waiting a day, incorporating the eggs and butter, watching it rise, and seeing it come out of the oven more than make up for the lack of overall quality? Hell yeah. I think we cook and eat for very different reasons all the time. The only important thing about cooking and eating is to be honest. Honest food is always good. For the restaurant cook, it depends on the restaurant. As an eater, I enjoy an honest $7 meal from a Dominican hot-table restaurant as much as I do a $250 tasting menu dinner from a New American restaurant. Just know where you are and what you're there for, whether it's at Le Gavroche or your living room couch.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1428815896"}}

{"text":"Hey, author of the post here. Here's a link to an article I wrote which has a bit more background info on the smashing technique. You're absolutely right - you want to smash at the beginning, but not once it starts cooking and the fat begins to liquefy. Smash once, leave it alone. As for the shrinking bit, that's why I use a stainless steel skillet with no oil in it. The meat binds to the metal (through actual covalent bonds!) when you press it down, so it keeps its size as it browns and sets. Then you scrape it up with a really stiff scraper or spatula. If you're talking about a more standard burger and not a smashed patty, then you'll want to make it slightly larger than the bun to start, and put a dimple in the center, which accounts for the fact that the edges cook (and therefore shrink) more than the center does. This compensates for the bulging that would happen if you cook a totally flat burger. More info on that here.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1396415789"}}

When you're deglazing, you're typically only using a few ounces while also continuing to apply heat and spreading that liquid around quickly to all parts of the pan, minimizing the net heat transfer's effect on the pan. Washing it in cold water causes a far larger and sustained heat dump, usually enough to cause the pan to cool very unevenly and hence warp. edit: As to washing in boiling water, you still have a pretty large temperature differential between frying and boiling, so yes, technically you do still run the risk of warping if you plunge a still-hot pan into the water.

Chicken makes soups, sandwiches, salads, curries, stir fries, French food, Italian food, Argentinian food, Malaysian food, Kenyan food; it has white meat, dark meat, gizzards and liver and hearts and feet; it poaches, it fries, it braises, it broils, it marinates, it salads, it rotisseries, it breads, it barbecues.

Leaving them to soak in a sink is asking to get a chunk of finger lopped off when you go to reach in there for something. Dry them straightaway (mind your fingers!) and store them exclusively in that knife block or on a magnetic strip, but never bare in a drawer, as all that rattling will lead to dull banged-up knives as well. Get a decent-quality honing steel and give the knives a good few strokes every couple of days or so if you use them often. Don't use glass cutting boards as they're awful for a blade.

If it's winter, it does well with a little cinnamon and chocolate chips added to the batter. Or you could make a fruit curd and swirl it through the batter instead. Endless customization. I've never had anyone complain about a nice lemony loaf cake with a thick glaze layer. Blood orange and olive oil is another winner combination. For holidays I like Creme brulee.

{"text":"How do you clean your cast iron?","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1441718681"}}
{"text":"This is my advice whenever this subject comes up. I'm going to straight up copy and paste one of my previous posts: --- I'm still not sure why carbon steel frying pans haven't caught on yet. Basically carbon steel frying pans are a kind of happy medium between cast iron and your standard non-stick pan. Like non-sticks, they heat up pretty quickly, but like cast iron they are very durable, can tolerate very high heats (unlike a non-stick!) and once properly seasoned are pretty non-stick. I love it for making eggs in the morning because unlike a cast iron, I don't have to wait 5-10 minutes for it to get properly hot. If you recognize the metal from their use in woks, which are pretty bad at holding heat, skillet style carbon-steel pans like the kind I'm talking about tend to be a little thicker and hold heat better. There are downsides: fast heating means fast cooling, too, so unlike cast iron, they can't hold heat as well and you're not going to get the kind of sear and heat you can get with a cast iron or a stainless steel pan. On the other hand, they're not terrible at holding heat, and if you get a bigger pan (which you might want anyway) and leave yourself some breathing room, this isn't a problem most of the time. They're also more expensive than cast iron and most non-sticks, but not by much. They also last forever (unlike non-sticks) so it ends up paying for itself over time. If you're trying to minimize kitchen items, the carbon steel frying pan is a great all-around, utility player. A good option is the Lodge Pre-Seasoned Carbon Steel Skillet, which like their cast iron comes pre-seasoned (but it's a good idea to do a round or three of seasoning anyway). If you get this, I highly recommend you pick up a silicone handle. It's almost a necessary accessory as it turns the pan from painful to hold due to heat and form to a friendly handshake from your frying pan. That is the one I have and it's easily my most used pan. That said, I do eat way more eggs than seared meats. On the other hand, if I had to I'd still feel comfortable cooking a good, well-seared steak in this pan if for some reason I couldn't reach for my cast iron (I couldn't say the same about a non-stick). If you want a little bit better heat retention, the deBuyer is in the same price range, but it's a little heavier, which'll help it retain heat. It doesn't come pre-seasoned, so you'll have to put a little bit more work into it. I don't own this, but it's generally a good, popular brand.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1423700431"}}

{"text":"I cook both ways. I have a health issue that screws up my sence of taste and smelling, some days. (headaches with auras and a pervision of smells. Ocassionally a fresh peach off the tree smells like rotten meat). My poor daughter has Zero sense of smell so her ability to taste is cockeyed too. So when we are sharing recipes we often use exact so things can always be duplicated. If I start adding spices from my imagination to a dish, I write it down exactly for Dear daughter. Thank good for a good cooking scale. My grand daughter is the offical taster and sniffer for our cooking marathons. I believe that recipes are a great place to start. If I offend someone with a too weird dish I just say Sorry and don't do that again. I totally believe that the sense of taste has a whole lot to do with genetics and your current life. Example. Science has proven that people that over use salt, often while they were in the womb, their mother had a lot of morning sickness/nausia. The mommy was often dehydrated from vomiting during the pregnancy. The developing baby is \"raised,\" so to speak in a high salt atmosphere. As a functioning human, they crave salty foods and often oversalt the foods they cook. Also our sense of taste has to do with the chemicals in our body. You have heard that certain meds will make your foods taste metalic or very blaw tasting. Each of us at the stove has to cook the way our family likes no matter what the recipe says. That is why there are about a million recipes for speggetti sauce, \"just like grandmas\". So one written recipe calls for a pinch of salt but the cook uses a tablespoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of sugar to get the flavor they want. Our medicines and the chemicals we put on our skin and use in our house, really make a difference in the way we taste/perceive a food.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1563436203}}

{"text":"Completely unnecessary to have separate boards. Cutting your vegetables first and then your meat is enough to prevent cross contamination as long as the board was cleaned properly in between uses. Use hot soapy water. If you wish, mix a solution of 1 tsp bleach with a quart of water and soak the surface for seceral minutes. Oil the board with mineral oil once per week. Some people here may recommend bamboo boards but please do not go for those. Those boards are a little too hard on your knives as they require a lot of glue. Always go for an end grain wood so your knives don\u2019t dull as fast. Choose a board with a thickness of at least 2\u201d for a board that will last. For the type of wood, I would go with a maple, beech, or walnut as these wont be too soft or too hard on your knives. Maple is the most traditional for cutting boards though. The optimal board size for me is 24\u201d by 18\u201d. And if you cant fit that board on your countertop, go for the biggest that you can. btw Plastic cutting boards were found to harbor more bacteria than wood cutting boards which is why it can be recommended to have color coded boards for meat and vegetables.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1539525310}}

{"text":"You can cook in an oven and then sear for foolproof results. If just using a pan, you will have to sear, flip, reduce temperature, then cook more slowly to the desired doneness so as to not burn the exterior. If using butter, I suggest also adding a bit of oil or to melt the butter first and skim off the foam and solids prior to using and then adding a little oil. A little bit of oil helps keep the butter from burning as quickly. If you have one of those little broiler ovens, you can just pop a steak in there for maybe 10 minutes at 300 degrees before searing both sides, resting, and slicing. I do not like ovening a steak in big conventional ovens. Smaller countertop boiler ovens are faster and more convenient. You can also sear first and then pop it into the oven. The goal is to make the center reach about 140 degrees while properly searing for a nice crust on the outside. There are many ways to make a steak.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1546038212}}

I lived close to my high school and was tired of having sandwiches and stuff for lunch, so I would think about what I felt like eating that day, and then go home and make it, based on some sort of recipe. Eventually you'll be able to cook without a recipe, and will have a 'bank' of good recipes in mind that you can use at any time. Simple recipes are often the best. Try to find authentic ones too. Look up \"How to Cook Well\" w/ Raymond Blanc on YouTube, as well as \"Two Greedy Italians\". That will give you a very nice framework of techniques and some good, easy recipes.

It's been an amazing success and I will now gladly eat things like beans, scallops, octopus, zucchini... but I was also lucky because my first experiences with those (and many other foods) were positive because the foods were properly prepared.

Dark chocolate is still a challenge because I don't always like the bitterness of it but I keep trying it and find that I like more and more. I think the key is to just keep exposing yourself to the foods you don't like in limited quantities over time until you either develop a taste for it or you learn to tolerate it.

{"text":"Is this a carbon steel pan or one of their other lines? Assuming it's carbon steel (that's most of what they sell in the US), it's pretty much impossible to damage it mechanically, though heating it very hot and then pouring very cold water on it can make it warp. Anyway, I'd avoid using high heat cause then you have plastic fumes in your house--no bueno. Most chemicals will not dissolve plastics sadly. If it's PTFE, only benzene will do the job. So you should scrape it off using a razor or a bench scraper. (if you're against this, you could try gasoline first) This is easier if the pan is very cold (put it in your freezer for a bit), or warm (not hot, you don't want plastic fumes). That should get most of it off, but don't season it till the plastic is completely gone. Then move on to Bar Keeper's Friend (or another scouring powder) or steel wool (I have never tried baking soda). You really can't damage the pan by scrubbing. Once it's off, I'd suggest heating it to burn off whatever tiny bit of residue that you didn't get off, then season as normal, being sure to remove any rust or discoloration that may have accumulated. One other thought, are you sure it's plastic and not the coating the factory applies to keep it from rusting until it's purchased?","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1491932776}}

There will definitely be vegetarians in a group that size, probably nut allergies as well as, perhaps, some gluten-free people. So avoid common allergens and meat as much as possible. Saves you from cooking and testing a bunch more dishes. You're cooking for college kids. They're kind of a middle ground: Not extremely picky, but with a limited palate, mostly used to cooking from a package (van die Knorr wereldgerechten kinders). If you do at least four courses, get some little menus printed with a lot of french in it, then it'll be \"classy\" enough. Now this first bit won't be classy, but it'll keep them occupied while you push out the first dish. Toasted bread or whatever you like, with some shit to put on it. Call it brochette de tapenade. (For the gluten free crowd you could whip up some socca/farinata. Chickpea flour can be found at toko's (probably), chinese supermarkets and indian places. May be referred to as besan in the latter.) Spreads: Duxelles (preferably with thyme) Onion confit Sun dried tomato tapenade (you can get them without oil at the market for about 8 euro/kg. Supermarkets will rip you off.) Sun dried tomatoes and oil will work, but you can add olives or chilis. Soup butternut squash soup with ginger Garnish with a dollop of whipped coconut milk (Get a few packages of \"santen\", it's like condensed coconut milk, but you have more control over the texture since you determine the amount of water.) Salad Salade nicoise Roast the potatoes, omit the anchovies. For the vegetarians, I would sub marinated chickpeas for the tuna. Main Beef bourguignon with mashed celeriac (knolselderij) and potatoes. If you like, you can roast the celeriac and potatoes if you have the oven space. Dessert Late October to November you should be able to find a shitton of quinces (kweepeer). Now you won't find these in supermarkets, but any decent market should have a ton of stalls offering them. Baked/poached quince with lime coulis (or ice cream if you want to go the conventional route) Bake slowly for hours or stew in spices red wine, kind of like you would with \"stoofperen\". These take a lot of time, though, cause they're hard as fuck. Finally, you're going to want to visit a market or turkish/islamic greem grocer to get some garnishes. Parsley and mint (cilantro as well, but let's not go there) will normally be 1 euro for three bunches.

Cut out the core of 1 Savoy or green cabbage, then drop cored side down into the water. Boil for 5-10 minutes, removing the outer layer of leaves as they become soft. Wrap the meat mixture in the cabbage rolls by placing a small amount near the base of the leaf, folding in the sides first. Roll up the leaves loosely as the uncooked rice will expand. Place the rolls seam side down on a plate and set aside. Chop up enough of the remaining cabbage leaves to make 1 cup.

{"text":"> Not going to jump into huge details here, but if you have any specific questions on food safety practices in general feel free to shoot me a question. Best way to have sanitizer solution around when you hardly would use it. I know in fast food we always had a dish of it around and it was fantastic for quick cleanups, but it gets really dirty. I just keep clorox wipes around and do a pass of wipe and another pass with a damp paper towel to get the residue off. Especially if meat gets somewhere. Is this probably the best alternative for home? That's one thing I've realized working fast food and the bit of restaurant chains, scaling makes some stuff so much easier. Like, I can't just go get my container of chopped onions, I have to sit there and chop one up, possibly dirty a dish to store it (if I need the cutting board) and repeat for pretty much everything. Dishes at home will almost always take a bit longer, kind of goes to your first point minimal ingredients can be great not only for flavor but ease of cooking. Of note with thermometers, try to get a thermocouple, not the run of the mill cheap thermometer. Thermocouples usually have a tiny taper at the end the size of a pencil led and only needs the very edge of the tip to read, so you don't have to lance your food to death to get a valid reading.

{"text":"You mentioned pulled pork, so this jumped to mind. for an amazing NC-style pulled pork BBQ from hog to plate, make sure to mop the pork with the vinegar BBQ sauce. Even if you can't do a whole hog and are instead smoking (preferred) or roasting a pork butt or shoulder, open the door every so often, remove any outer shell of cooked meat and baste with some sauce. As for the sauce, every NC BBQ master has their own recipe, but if you really want that sauce to pop, add some red pepper flakes and bring the concoction to a boil. That helps the flavors to blend. Alternately, you can just let the sauce sit overnight to blend a little. I'm from NC and now live in VA. We tried a new BBQ place in MD, so of course, I tried some of their pulled pork and sauce. the pork was pretty good (hickory smoked), but I almost wept at the sauce: apple cider vinegar, a little sugar, some salt, and pre-ground black pepper. It was so bland and just tasted like pepper. edit: One more trick for pecan pie. I use 2.5 cups of pecan halves per pie, which mounds up nicely with the custard base. I also use a basting brush to spread chocolate liqueur on the crust. A former co-worker shunned my pie at a company potluck, saying he hated pecan pies. After the potluck, he comes to my office carrying an empty pie plate.

{"text":"First, the protein content of the flour is critical. You should be looking for the equivalent of an American all purpose flour, which isn't going to be easy to track down in Europe. American AP is 11.8% protein, which comes out to a 13.8% protein European equivalent. Depending on what country you're in, you're probably not going to walk into a market and find a white, additive free 13.8% protein flour. I spend a great deal of time helping European source American pizza flour, which is another percentage point higher. That's only available online via import. You might find an unadulterated (no vital wheat gluten) white bread flour in the 13% realm that might cut it, but, if you want to save yourself a load of time, I can give you links for pizza flour, and you can just, if necessary, dilute it with some local flour. After finding the right flour, the key to a fluffy pancake is watching your water content. Extra water makes for a denser pancake, because it takes a great deal of energy to heat, which slows down the bake and hinders volume. A fluffy pancake should have batter that requires a bit of spreading with a spatula.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1541265551}}

I put the bacon and egg on the toasted english muffin and put a piece of american cheese on it and wrap it in foil. I can eat that on the way to work along with some juice/milk or coffee. Way better and cheaper than a breakfast sandwich from a fast food place. I also make pancakes and waffles and freeze those as well as partially bake sausage links then freeze. The pancakes/waffles heat up in the toaster and I microwave the sausage when I am ready to eat it. Another thing I do is fry up bulk breakfast sausage and freeze it. I have frozen biscuits and those take about 25 minutes to bake. While the biscuits are baking, I make a roux and add some milk to it, then put the frozen sausage in it to make sausage gravy for the biscuit.

{"text":"Don't thaw your salmon in water. Put it in on a plate, in plastic, in your fridge overnight (ca 8-10 hours). Then you season it, leave for five minutes at room temp and cook it. A few tips on cooking salmon well: * Searing it in a quality pan is the best and easiest way. This also gives you much more control of the heat than in an oven. * Fire your pan up to mid-high (7/10), add 1 tbs of olive oil and let it get nice and hot. Then you turn the pan down to medium (5/10) before you add the salmon. * Us your hands, utensils can break your filet. When adding in the pan, make sure the fish \"lands\" pointing away from you. This way you don't get splashed by really fucking hot oil. * Watch it as it cooks. You can see the color changing from the bottom to the top. When it's tanned about 40%, you flip it. Again, just use your hands. This should be the only time in the cooking process you touch the fish in the pan. * Your salmon is done when its cooked 40% through on each side. About 1/5th of the filet size should be pink in the middle. Images for reference: Perfect vs overcooked. GL.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1464100972}}

I think I've got a couple of tips :) Here's a video for 4 different ways to prepare your eggs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIZNHQC01K4 And a ton of different egg recipes to spark your creativity: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/egg-recipes and https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/best-egg-recipes/ As for having a college budget, I recommend making lots of frittatas or quiches. Those can last you over a couple days, and you can put a variety of ingredients in there depending on what you have! Bacon, ham, cold cuts, veggies, potatoes, make your own flavor combos: https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/frittata-recipes/ When you want to start cooking with wine, I highly recommend using red wine for your meats, and white wine for chicken or fish. You can also tackle that vanilla extract any time you want, it can be pretty cheap and adds loads of flavor. One small bottle of that stuff will last you a long time. You can make yourself pancakes, or even muffins and scones to last you over the course of the week. You could even do something like a quick bread, like banana bread, blueberry bread, chocolate chip bread: http://www.midwestliving.com/food/breakfast/sweet-bread-treats/?page=5, they'd be great with some coffee or tea for breakfast. When it comes to cheap ingredients, I recommend Struggle Meals by Tastemade on Youtube! You cold also make chili or cold pasta salads which can be cheap and very versatile depending on what's available or on sale at your local store. Chili: https://www.epicurious.com/recipes-menus/best-chili-recipes-gallery Cold pasta salads: https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g2365/pasta-salad-recipes/ You could also make tacos, burritos, burrito bowls, fajitas, and quesadillas if you're into that type of cuisine! They're all very versatile: https://tasty.co/recipe/weekday-meal-prep-chicken-burrito-bowls and https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/quesadilla-recipes-quick-dinner/ Asian inspired meals could be fun too, like teriyaki chicken, beef and broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, all of these can be served with a side of jasmine rice.

{"text":"Don't use fresh tomatoes unless you get them from a reliable source, like a farmer's market you trust. Otherwise use canned, since canned tomatoes are picked ripe. Supermarket tomatoes tend to be picked and shipped green, then ripened via exposure to ethylene gas. They don't develop the flavors they would on the vine. If you do get fresh tomatoes, they take a very long cook time due to all the water. My mom grows her own and they are delicious, but she freezes hers before turning them into tomato sauce. It removes a very large percentage of the water without much effort or energy. You can even give them a squeeze at that point if you want them really dry for a dish. Regarding the blandness, you should add more umami ingredients. Mushrooms, worcestershire or other fish sauce, or even straight up MSG are good options. It's a salt as well, but a different type than NaCl. If you want a slightly sweeter sauce, you can add a finely grated carrot.

{"text":"California + Southern. California's traditional style of food is really heavy on fresh, local produce with influences from Central America and Asia. Name a fruit or vegetable, and odds are good we grow quite a lot of it from broccoli to garlic to walnuts to plums to almonds to spinach. All of that ends up in our local food, oftentimes raw. We're not just In-n-Out Animal-Style tacos with avocado, we're the produce section of the continental United States. Southern food, on the other hand, is all about the fusion of many different cultures, from West African to French to Italian to Native American, with sub-types like creole and floribbean. Barbecue from Native Americans, okra from Africa, fried meats, cooked vegetables, butter, beans, and spices are all big parts of Southern traditional cooking. California is, in my experience, more about fresh ingredients, while Southern cooking, again in my experience, is more about the classic recipe and process. What would this look like? Grill up chicken thighs in spice rub and sauce until they're crisp, sweet and spiced on the outside and fall-apart warm on the inside. Combine this with Monterey jack cheese, saut\u00e9ed red bell pepper and zucchini, grilled corn, black beans, and roasted pumpkin seeds inside a traditional tortilla. Bam: fusion chicken quesadilla. Salt and pepper some cube steaks, drop in flour-pepper-paprika-cayenne-cilantro dry mixture, then milk and eggs mixture. Fry in peanut oil until golden brown, then leave to drip. Meanwhile, combine sweet red chili sauce, tamarind, minced garlic, fish sauce, grated ginger, lime, and a little Sriracha into a sweet and spicy sauce. Cut up the chicken-fried steak into strips, and put over a salad of edamame, baby kale, carrots, red and yellow bell pepper, cilantro, green onions, and peanuts, then coat with the Thai chili sauce.

{"text":"> nd ground chili powder. I'm not pro-level enough to grind my own spices, other than pepper. I don't use cilantro in chili but I do love it for other things. The cocoa and coffee add background depth, they aren't really upfront flavors. I generally whisk some cocoa powder into some leftover black coffee from that morning's breakfast and stir it in after some of the other (beer usually) has been absorbed/cooked down. Good luck with it. I won 2nd place in the only chili cook-off I have ever entered with this chili. I cooked the beans the night before from dry, no cans, and pureed 3/4 of them to add body to the chili, and kept the other 1/4 whole. You could change that ratio if you like more whole beans in yours. I do but thought that the judges might not. Another step beyond, but still fairly easy, is to take a giant spoonful of a Mole Negro paste or something like that. I do that and a whole can of chipotles in adobo for my pressure cooker chili, and it always turns out with a way greater depth of flavor than just chili powders.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1538162626}}

Let sit with some kosher salt and cracked black pepper for 1-2 hours in a fridge, then sear in a really hot pan for about 2 minutes on each side and serve medium rare. They go really well with plum sauce, cherry sauce, orange sauce, masala wine sauce, or just eat them straight. If they still have skin, lay a sharp knife flat against the skin, press slightly and draw the knife across. This should score a nice cut into the skin and fat, but not the meat below. Then treat as mentioned above, or roast as below. You can also trim off the fat and treat as above. If it still has bones AND skin, score as described, then steam for 45 minutes in a metal steamer. At the same time, heat up a cast iron skillet in an oven at 475 degrees F. After the 45 minutes are over, transfer skin-side down into the hot skillet and immediately place back into the oven for 7 minutes. There's a bunch more, but those are my usual prep methods.

{"text":"My gf and I prepare a casserole or large dish every Sunday night, which serves as dinner and makes 3-4 lunches for both of us throughout the week. We also freeze some and rotate them, so we might eat the same one 2-3 times and take one from a previous week. We generally rotate around: * Lentil dahl or variation of some lentil dish. * Lasagna or some other pasta dish. Sometimes with meat, sometimes without. Rigatoni with italian sausage is one of my favs. * Mexican casserole with beans, corn, cheese., or some combo of tex-mex inspired food that does large portions like tons of fajitas (which freeze great), or a big enchilada casserole. * Big batch of stew or curry with lots of vegetables. Basically anything that doesn't take too long to make a big batch of, is healthy and is lunchable. Of course we'll make food with leftovers sometimes during the week, but I find it better to eat a salad or sandwich (which aren't great to keep overnight) at night and take my big meal at lunch. Furthermore, IMO, it's not really efficient to spend time cooking the night before if you're not planning on making a meal out of it. If you're gonna be in the kitchen, might as well eat, right? :) Extend that, and the best way to spend your kitchen time is to prep a lot of food in advance. If you really need a quick meal to prepare as a last minute thing to make a lunch, like the other commenters said, sandwiches are the quickest.

{"text":"To your example about dough recipes, often overlooked issues include 1. quality of ingredient and 2. environment. There are simply some recipes that are impossible to replicate because the ingredients are specific (using all purpose can tomatoes vs. San Marzano tomatoes for pizzas, e.g.) or using filtered water vs. tap water for a dough. Store bought AP flour isn't the same as using a specialty flour Then there are the environmental factors. Breads and other pastries simply cannot do a proper rise if the humidity is too high too low, or if the altitude isn't favorable, or if it's too cold or too hot. People also don't often have the right equipment at home. Conventional stove tops don't get nearly hot enough to cook some foods. So while cooking at home is great and recommended, you get a different experience when you eat out for reasons. On top of all the other comments about being able to make fine adjustments away from the recipe, you have all these other outside factors that affect your meal.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1520452721}}

Putting it in the oven browned the top perfectly and underneath was still soft and fluffy. The past few days I\u2019ve been scrambling eggs and putting saut\u00e9ed onions tomatoes garlic spinach and bacon into them and they\u2019re freaking good. What I\u2019ve learned in the past few days is to literally just try something new. I thought that frittata was gonna be shit and it took me an hour and a half to make but it turned out to be one of the best things I\u2019ve ever made. Bacon grease is all right but I\u2019ve noticed that when you use bacon grease the eggs are saturated in it. When you use butter it allows the eggs to get less moist in my experience. Another thing is the veggies. If you like them hard and crunchy, I do not, throw them in about 1-2 minutes before your eggs r done. If you like em soft saut\u00e9 them in a pan and then throw them in like just a few minutes before the eggs r done. Garlic is ok but use sparingly because I think that it will override all of the other flavors and we don\u2019t want that.

Drain them, reserving some of the water (maybe 1/2 a cup). Put the rehydrated chilies in a food processor or blender with a little olive oil, salt, black pepper, and additional spices that you'd like. I add a little dark cocoa powder to mine. You can also add a little bit of the water back into it, if it seems too thick or dry. You'll end up with an amazing, deep, chili paste. When you brown the meat, add some of the paste. Add some to the veggie mix you sautee as well, and then when you mix the veggies, meat, stock, tomatoes etc, add the paste as you would chili powder. oh man, it's so delicious.

I'd suggest reducing both the butter and sugar (although you still want it to coat the sweet potatoes, to protect it from drying out too much), but cooking it longer and lower at first, possibly covered, to help bring out the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes and make them soft enough. Roasting sweet potatoes slowly can get you an almost candylike result without any added sugar, whereas cooking them quickly in the microwave always gives a blander, starchier result.

By the time it's cooked, there is no onion texture but you have wonderful onion flavor. Definitely a better taste than onion powder to me.

{"text":"Step 1: Need to eat. Step 2: Don't have income. Well, that's one way to motivate yourself to start cooking. The how is a little more hit-and-miss. As other people said, help out in the kitchen. Good knifework is probably the skill most worth developing - start early; learn how not to cut yourself. Learn the difference between cutting with a sharp knife and a dull knife, and then *never* use a dull knife again because that's how you lose a finger. Either can cut you, but only a dull knife is unpredictable. Taste every spice and every ingredient you can. Once in awhile, I'll even risk a bite of raw meat or egg just to better understand the flavor I'm working with. Ruin dishes. Add a sprinkle of salt, taste, and add a sprinkle more. Try to identify where the perfect amount is, then go past it to confirm that you added too much. Same goes for how long you bake something for, how much you thicken a soup/sauce, etc. etc. The point here is that learning happens by trying something new, regardless of whether or not it's going to turn out well (which it often won't).

{"text":"Charring is cool, just don't bother trying to take skins off; way too fiddly on a small, thin-fleshed pepper. When I make green salsa, I take half of everything except cilantro (chiles, tomatillos, onion, whatever) and roast that. Then I take half of the roasted, half of the raw &amp; blenderize it. The other halves I chop up. So 1/4 is roasted and processed smooth, 1/4 is roasted and chunky, 1/4 is raw and chunky, 1/4 is raw &amp; smooth. If that makes sense. Not saying it's the greatest, but people seem to like it. If you want a hot, flavorful pepper that you CAN scorch &amp; rub skin off, try a Manzano (spelling?) if you have a middle eastern store nearby; they seem to carry them. The ones I've gotten were hot as hell, but not sure if they are always like that. Very fleshy, about the size of a small slicing tomato, and thick-walled.

{"text":"Potato soup. You can dress it up or down, but it's delicious and hearty. Maybe not great if you're in the hemisphere moving into summer, but a good standby for the winter blahs. I start by sauteing garlic and onions in olive oil (or butter, or the grease left over from cooking up homemade bacon bits...just saying...) in a large stock pot. while cooking, I dice up a bunch of Yukon gold potatoes (or russet or Idaho or whatever floats your boat). After the onions and garlic are nice and soft, I add the potatoes into the pot with enough chicken stock to cover all the potatoes. I add salt and pepper. How much will differ with what kind of stock you use. Less is more in this instance as you can adjust later. I also add celery seed and rosemary and whatever other spices jump out at me from the cabinet. I boil the crap out of the potatoes until they're soft. Remove from heat. Then I add a little milk (or cream, or more chicken stock or butter or a combo of all or try something like yogurt or sour cream). I take my stick blender and whirr the whole thing until its relatively smooth. I like it a little chunky. If you need more liquid, add it now. Taste. Does it need salt? Add salt. Do you love cheese? Stir in some shredded cheese while it's still smoking hot. Serve with green onions, bacon bits, shredded cheese. If you have leftover steak, might I suggest a blue cheese and steak panini on the side? Or steak on a bed of salad greens with blue cheese crumbles?

{"text":"*Pan Temperature** Frying is normally done in oil that measures between 350 and 375\u00b0 using an infrared thermometer. There are several methods that can be used to determine the proper temperature without using a thermometer. *Brown Butter Method* Put butter in the pan and begin heating. As the pan heats up, the butter will melt. When the pan reaches a temperature of 212\u00b0, the butter will start to bubble as the water in the butter starts to evaporate. As the temperature rises, sputtering increases and then stops. The milk solids in the butter begin to brown rapidly when the temperature reaches 250\u00b0. This is hot enough for low temperature frying, sweating onions, or making omelets. *Shimmering Oil Method* Put canola oil in the pan and begin heating. As the pan heats up, the oil will flow smoothly and quickly around the bottom of the pan. When the pan reaches a temperature of 275\u00b0, the surface of the oil begins to glisten and shimmer. When the oil is shimmering all over the pan, the temperature is 325 to 350\u00b0. Continue heating and a few wisps of smoke emerge when the temperature is around 375\u00b0. By the time the temperature reaches 400\u00b0, multiple wisps will be easily visible rising from the pan. *Chopstick Method (Chinese Stir-fry Test)* Place the handle of a wooden spoon or chopstick into the oil. If the oil bubbles steadily, the oil is hot enough for frying. If the oil bubbles furiously, the oil is too hot and needs to cool off a little. If no or very few bubbles form, the oil is not hot enough. *Bread Cube Method (Joy Of Cooking)* Drop a half-inch cube of bread into the oil. If it takes 60 seconds to brown, the oil is at 365\u00b0. *Popcorn Method (Cooks Illustrated)* Drop a single kernel of popcorn into the oil as it is heating. The kernel will pop when the oil reaches between 350 and 360\u00b0 (Remove the kernel and start frying) *Leidenfrost Effect (Rouxbe Cooking School)* The Leidenfrost effect occurs when a dry pan heats up, at 374\u00b0 an eighth of a teaspoon of water will form immediately into a single ball that glides around on the surface of the pan. As the temperature increases the water test shows: * The water pools and evaporates slowly (tepid) * The water boils quickly and evaporates rapidly (warm) * The water boils vigorously and evaporates very rapidly (warmer) * The water steams rather than boils and evaporates immediately (not hot enough) * The water pool breaks into multiple small balls that dance around the surface of the pan (almost there) * The water forms immediately into a single ball that glides around on the surface of the pan (perfectly hot) * The water spurts immediately into multiple small balls that disperse quickly (too hot)","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1521555086}}

{"text":"No no no don't just let it sit during the stall. The reason it plateaus for several hours is due to evaporative cooling where the energy from the moisture of the pork evaporating equals out against the energy being put into the meat by the cooker. If you wrap it up in foil when it gets to the stall, it will continue to gain energy from the cooker but will retain the moisture thus causing the meat to continue rising in internal temperature. If you leave it wrapped in foil until it hits around 200 you will have a far juicier shoulder compared to letting it sweat off moisture in the stall.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1472013044}}

Kosher salt - 1 Tbsp. black pepper - 1 lb. pack of skinless boneless chicken thighs, saut\u00e9ed just until done and then pulled Saut\u00e9e the onions and garlic in a large pot over medium-low heat with butter or oil until fragrant. Pour in the pumpkin and stock and whisk together. Add salt and pepper, then either season further with a tablespoon of red curry paste or literally whatever seasonings you want! I usually use a squirt of sriracha, a few shakes of onion powder, and pinches of cinnamon, oregano, paprika, and thyme (tasting and adding as you go is important with this recipe). Let heat on medium-low for 8 minutes. While this is cooking, make the chicken. Whisk in the coconut milk, add in the cooked, shredded chicken, and continue to let cook on medium-low for 10 more minutes. Bam, delicious, super hearty soup. The chicken can be replaced with other proteins, the pumpkin pur\u00e9e can be replaced with other pur\u00e9ed vegetables, and it can be made for vegetarians or meat lovers. Add corn, add black beans, add crumbled bacon, whatever you want! I have made so many variations.

{"text":"At CIA we began marinara (red sauce) with bacon; surprisingly, it makes a huge difference. &amp;#x200B; **However**, if your vegan or vegetarian, I have come up with what I've dubbed \"Fakon.\" Start with vegetable oil or olive oil to cover the bottom of your pot (don't waste extra virgin olive oil at this level); add 2 level Tbl Smoked Paprika, 1 tsp Liquid Smoke (I uses Stubb's Mesquite), 3-6 drops of Toasted Sesame Oil. Fakon smells and tastes just like bacon in this application. It will give your marinara a base background to build upon. The quantities are only to give you a ratio of Paprika to Liquid Smoke to Sesame Oil. Be careful not to use too much sesame oil, as it will give your food an Asian flavor if there's too high a percentage of it. &amp;#x200B; Once you've got the oil and fakon going, add in peeled, crushed garlic and get a little color on it ... slowly. Once the garlic has become translucent, add in the mirepoix (2pts chopped onion, 1pt chopped celery, 1pt chopped carrots) onions first, and get a little color on the the onions (deeper color = deeper flavor). Once the garlic and onions have a little color on them, add in the celery and carrots. I also like to add a layer of diced portabella mushrooms, nicely browned in butter to the mix. It adds another layer or umami complexity to the sauce. &amp;#x200B; If you're using fresh tomatoes, make sure you concass\u00e9 the tomatoes first. Concass\u00e9 gets rid of the skin and the seeds and their gel-like goop. Skins are bitter, and the seeds' gel sort of waters down the flavor of your sauce. Also, if anyone you know has issues with diverticulitis, they can't eat seeds or skin. It may seem like a pain, but it's worth it if you want a high quality sauce. &amp;#x200B; Then simmer slowly. Add equal amounts of salt and sugar (dark brown sugar will add more flavor). Actually, the amount of sugar depends on the acidity of your tomatoes; You're looking for balance. Add the balance of your herbs and spices to taste. The only two herbs I never use dried in this sauce are basil and parsley; always use fresh for both, because drying changes them. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1553715625}}

{"text":"The purpose of brining, mainly, is to retain moisture in lean cuts of meat during high heat cooking. Pork shoulder is cooked low and slow and has plenty of fat to keep it moist and succulent. If you brine it, you will find it has a texture closer to ham, which is not what you're looking for with pulled pork. Brining will also prevent the bark from forming properly, which (for me) is the best part of pulled pork. To make the best pulled pork, use a rub all over the surface of the pork, then wrap it and refrigerate it overnight. Remove from the refrigerator about 40 min to an hour before cooking, regardless of method. Of course, smoking is optimal, but you can get excellent results in an oven.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1346531258"}}

{"text":"Cook to temp, not to time. Follow the advice of the other commenter and buy an instant-read probe thermometer; we're talking six bucks. You just need to bring the meat up to 165\u00b0. I've always had great results with the Cook's Illustrated method of flipping the bird three times during cooking. Start it on its side, wing-side up, and after 20mins flip it to its other side, wing-side up. After another 20mins flip it onto its back, so it's breast-side up. I always baste it after each rotation. This sounds like a lot of work, but if you're chilling in the kitchen while you cook it really isn't. **edit:** use either a roasting rack, balls of aluminum foil, or side items like onions and potatoes to hold it in place. Onions and potatoes will roast with the pan drippings and be delicious. Another tip is to pre-moisten the breasts by loosening the skin and putting butter and lemon under it. Literally just stick your fingers under the raw skin and loosen it away from the meat; you'll have to tear a slight membrane and if it's your first time it might feel a little uncontrolled. That's ok. The skin isn't going to float off if you loosen it \"wrong\"; there isn't a wrong way to do it. Slice a stick of butter into, like, 1/8tbsp pieces (your stick of butter has a printed measuring stick on the wrapper, just cut the smallest increment, which is a tablespoon, in half) and slip them under the skin. Bonus points for slicing 1/2 of a fresh lemon into thin wheels and slipping them in with the butter; stick the rest of the un-sliced lemon up the chicken's cavity before you throw it in the oven. The breast is the first part of the chicken to dry out because it has the least fat, so you want to add liquid to it during cooking however you can. Cooking it with butter and/or citrus under the skin (limes and oranges work just as well) and basting it will do this. Alternatively, if you don't really care about the skin, boil it. Stick that sucker into cold water and bring it to boil in a stockpot. In about 25 minutes it'll be *done.* The skin will be useless mush so discard it, but the meat will be tender and perfect for use in just about any recipe.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1548552924}}

Curry powder, on the other hand, is a combination of less aromatic and more basic spices (cumin, coriander, turmeric, Kashmiri chili powder, and such).

It's wonderful to not have the mental hassle of choosing and planning, and the physical time of shopping, for every meal 2. It's a really great way to learn to cook and expand your cooking techniques and repertoire. (Much cheaper than cooking lessons, and easier and more structured than working your way through a cookbook). 3. You get far more variety for a lower price than you would do with supermarket shopping 4. It's more expensive than supermarket shopping: *unless* you're an impulse buyer/poor planner/lover of more gourmet foods. 5. In the latter case (more gourmet meals) I've had Marley Spoon meals before that cost less than buying at the supermarket. Eg one that came with four different fresh herbs: at a major Australian supermarket, these would be at least $10-12. 6. With Marley Spoon you get to choose each week's meals from a list of seven - OR you can just let them pre-select. This is great if there's a particular ingredient you don't like. With many recipe delivery services, you get what you're given, no choice. **The bad...** 1. Packaging waste. It's pretty awful. Supposedly the cardboard is recyclable, but every week comes with these silver cold bags with frozen gel/ice packs within. All this gets chucked out. (Sure you could re-use - but who needs more than one or two? You'll be getting half a dozen more each week). 2. Currently they make it very hard to switch between Couples and Family. You have to adjust your account settings, at a specific time each week so you don't reset your in-progress order. You can't mix it up either. It's a shame, because 2-person during the week, with one Family on weekends would be ideal.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1475485664}}

{"text":"Hello fellow night shift worker. I know what you mean about being not being hungry for the first few hours after you wake up. From my experience its not really worth forcing yourself to eat if you're not hungry, but as far as your mood is concerned you're probably going to be a much happier person if you've eaten before you go to work. Porridge and toast can be bland, but they can also be exciting. For instance, try changing the bread you buy around, or more importantly, buying higher quality bread, as well as butter, and then buying a small selection of different jams. I enjoy Apricot Jam a little too much (I grew up on a stone fruit orchard), so I went and bought strawberry, orange and a mixed fruit jam to add to my collection. I stopped there because those jams will collectively last me a year. With porridge your best friend is fruit. I don't know how you serve your porridge currently but when I used to eat (I don't anymore) I added a small dollop of fresh cream and served it with diced fruit on top. Mint is also relatively neutral, so if you're a fan of mint adding a few leaves might also be worth a try (Spearemint would be my go to). Alternatively you could add muesli and yogurt to your diet, as well as cold meats, cheeses etc. Its starting to get cold here in Australia so what I've started to do is put the oven on, peel some potatoes, carrots, turnips, sweet potatoes etc and then just roast them in the oven. They take long enough that by the time they are ready I am hungry, and the beautiful aroma means I'm usually famished. Its also the kind of meal that requires enough effort for reward that it feels like its worth the while, and leaves you plenty of time to clean up while you wait. If you're a fan of ritual then I strongly recommend it.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1430154734"}}

Otherwise, I think you need to learn to love stainless steel (well, stainless-clad aluminum). Maybe you've just been using shit pans or maybe you just need to get a little more practice, but it shouldn't be difficult to get good results from a quality fully clad stainless pan. All-Clad is the gold standard, but Tramontina is usually thrown around as a much cheaper but still good alternative. I'd recommend getting one pan (a 10\" skillet is probably most versatile if you're cooking for yourself/you and one other person) and getting familiar with it. If you're used to cooking on nonstick it's obviously a little different, but it's so much better once you're used to it. One other option would be carbon steel, but in a lot of ways it basically just works like thinner (and less heavy) cast iron, so I don't see much point in having both.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1488898367}}

Deboned, I like the kind with skin on one side * Salt * Pepper * Olive oil * Lemon juice (optional) **Recipe:** 1) At least 2 hours before cooking, earlier if possible, submerge the plank in water and let it soak (weigh it down with something so it's completely covered) 2) If using a charcoal grill, start the coals. If using gas, you can turn it on later. 3) Cover flesh side of salmon with a thin layer of olive oil, then salt and pepper to taste. You can add lemon juice here if desired, but I don't think it needs it. 4) Take plank out of the water, place salmon on the plank 5) Once the grill is hot, place the salmon (with plank) on the grill and close it. I use indirect heat, putting the charcoal on one side, and food on the other. 6) Cook for 8-15 minutes (cooking times vary greatly depending on your grill), until the fish is 120-130 F for medium rare. If you don't have a thermometer, it should flake easily with a fork 7) Let rest for 5 minutes covered in foil. Enjoy!","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1548087308}}

Recently, I've been delving more into good blogs and online recipes, and I have to say I'm hitting it out of the park! I still occasionally make changes to dishes that I'm more familiar with, since I'm pretty comfortable working with different flavors and cooking methods. FYI, just because you follow a recipe doesn't mean you're not a good cook. You still have to understand and do things right. On the flip side, I've known many people (my mom in particular; don't tell her I said so) who could follow the exact same recipe and end up with something really bad. Some things that I've been making and getting rave reviews lately on are nearly foolproof however, especially using a slow cooker. I've been trying to find the most creative and delicious slow cooker ethnic meals that I can think of. I take the complements because I found the recipe, bought the ingredients, followed the directions and ended up with way better food for my family and friends than they would have made themselves. I've had people say they've never had that particular food outside of a restaurant, or that they didn't know you could make that in a Crock Pot. I've had some people say it's some of the best food they've ever had! Following recipes helps you discover all the culinary treasures, many that you'd miss if you just made up your own dishes all the time. Do yourself a favor and accept the compliment.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1548309140}}

{"text":"I cook salmon for tourists in Alaska during summers. When salmon is fresh, it's almost always outstanding. When it's been frozen, it can pick up an slight freezer-burn taste quicker than white fish. The problem is the fat. If the fish has been frozen longer than a few weeks, the fat starts to pick up that off-taste. Using a sharp knife, skin the fillet, flip it over, then carefully cut away some of the grey fat that runs down the centerline. You don't need to get it all, just most of it. I almost always pan fry or grill salmon. I don't like to bake it, because it's easier to let it get away and become overcooked that way. If I'm frying or grilling, it's right in front of me, and I can devote my attention. There's no need to go nuts about seasoning. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and paprika, then sear in olive oil at high heat. Once the surface looks nice, flip it over, turn down the heat and cook until done.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1421214955"}}

{"text":"Cold oil goes in to hot pan. Don't heat oil as the pan is warming up. Flour is flammable. DON'T USE IT ON A FIRE. Baking soda works for small fires, but have an extinguisher around at all times, but do not keep it next to a heat source, it could implode. Also, a pan lid big enough to smother flames. DON'T IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE LID AFTER THE FLAME LOOKS OUT. It's highly likely as soon as you remove the lid, oxygen will cause it to flair right back up. Remove it from the heat, and carry the pan outside. Let it cool before removing the lid. Another note, if it's your burner on fire, smother first, and throw the breaker to your stove. Don't remove the lid until it's cooled. A falling knife has no handle. Don't go after it if you drop it. Never leave anything cooking on the stove unattended, even for a moment. Keep handles, oven mitts, and dish towels away from the stove. Don't wear loose sleeves or fuzzy sweaters. Open pans with lids away from you.

{"text":"You can do this; like with chocolate-chip cookies, the basic recipes are all on the packaging! Read them at the store so you get what you need. Even if you're alone, you're going to want leftovers as a reward for doing this work, so a Cornish Hen may not be enough. So first decide if you actually like turkey, and choose light or dark meat if you do, so you don't have too much. Otherwise go with chicken. Roast it in a pan by itself. You'll have room in the oven for a separate casserole of stuffing, and a yam or two. When the yams get soft you can scoop them into a heatable dish and add butter, brown sugar, a little salt, and marshmallows if you want. On the stove you can saute the chopped onion, celery, and apple in plenty of butter for the stuffing, and boil a couple potatoes to mash with milk and more butter.... (I like to use Canola Harvest for some of the butter, BTW) Buy a jar of turkey gravy, and add it to the fresh drippings from your bird. Remember, the microwave is your friend when it comes to having all the sides hot at the end together. Green veg is up to you; do you like salad or green-bean casserole? Or would you rather just crunch the inevitable extra celery with some dip while you watch the game? And do you like cranberries as raw relish or cooked (or canned) sauce or just want to toss a few Craisins in your stuffing? The whole joy of a self-thanksgiving is to make and eat only the stuff you like best. Which brings me to pie. \"So he laid out a simple picnic lunch. There was nothing but pie. But there were all nine kinds of pie that Harold liked best.\" -- Harold and the Purple Crayon Pumpkin is the easiest. And to be honest, messing with the basic on-the-can recipe usually disappoints your hindbrain, which knows the \"right\" flavor too well. You can make the pie the day before and warm it in the turned-off oven when you take the bird out. Pecan is my favorite, and is not hard, (recipe on the Karo jar) but I've been known to buy one, or at least buy frozen pie crusts. Apple is a project in itself, maybe better for another day; only do work that pleases you. Keep in mind you'll have dishes to wash; that's why I do my pumpkin pie in the blender.

Instead of starting tge cooking process with sauteeing onions and garlic and other stuff, you directly start boiling and cooking. In the end, you heat up clarified butter or oil on high, almost to smoke point, then add whole spices like mustard seeds, cumin seeds and optionally coriander seeds, asafoetida powder, whole dried red chilis broken up. Onions or shallots and garlic is also often added. White lentils are also added as they become crispy crunchy bits and add texture and nuttiness. Then the whole thing is poured on top of the cooked dish. A variant of this, especially for a gentler saute, is to sprinkle powdered spices on top of the cooked dish. Then very hot clarified butter or oil is poured on top of the spices.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1511104708}}

Make sure to cook the roux enough; too raw rouxes are often the source of graininess. Add the milk hot, but not anywhere close to boiling, and all at once, whisking until combined. Don't worry if it doesn't thicken right away. Be patient with the sauce and let it thicken on its own through heat before doing anything drastic. When thickened add cheese, but keep the heat low or off. Mix just until uniform.

The only change I make is to use a graham cracker crust instead of regular pastry (thought I may have to try the ginger snaps somebody mentioned here!) **Jessie\u2019s Heirloom Key Lime Pie** Jessie's story from a hospice nurse: Several years ago I treated a young man from Key West, Florida who was dying of AIDS. A couple of weeks before he died, he gave me his 75-year-old family recipe for Key Lime Pie. He explained that most Key Lime Pie recipes use condensed milk. Even restaurants in Key West serve Key Lime Pie made with condensed milk. Jessie was disdainful of this version. His family recipe, passed from generation to generation, does not used condensed milk. Jessie claimed it is the only authentic Key Lime Pie recipe. So in memory of Jessie, I offer it to you. Please keep the story with Jessie's recipe. Thanks.

The cool thing is that you can just throw then in the campfire or put them in the grill. Since you have done all the prep at home you can do more relaxing at the campsite. I have one, or both with every meal. Another thing I like to do camping is Kabobs! Cut all your meat (beef, chicken, pork or even add shrimp) and put in a zip lock with your favorite marinade. Then do the same with some vegetables in a separate bag. The good thing about this is that you can make kabobs anytime you get the munchies with little or no work. I break them out late-night for the stoner snack. Also grilled veggie kabobs for breakfast with my eggs.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1373998200"}}

Saute sliced onions and garlic in oil in a pan with some salt. Go low and slow for about half hour until the onions and garlic caramelize and turn dark brown. Now add some diced tomatoes, some tomato paste, sliced ginger, turmeric powder (1tsp), red chili or cayenne powder (1tsp), cumin powder (1tsp), coriander powder (2tsp). Add the cauliflower florets. Optionally add boiled cubed potatoes (boil potatoes for 6-8 minutes in the microwave in a steamer bag and a sprinkle of water). Add 1 cup water. Cover and cook until cauliflower is cooked.

If it's really bad you can mix in some degreaser with the water. Once you've got it spotless, rinse with water and the polish with lemon juice or vinegar (I prefer lemon juice). It's much easier to clean when hot. And this doesn't matter as much for home (since you probably only use it once and don't let it sit on for hours) it should be scraped with a bench knife and wipe down between uses. If you leave stuff on it cooks on. If you aren't anal about getting it perfectly clean you will experience carbon build up and/or discolouration that a normal cleaning won't get off.

My favorite really is using mini pie pans to make fruit pie crusts and make pie filling. Another good idea is to make several cookie doughs then freeze as dough balls. Throw a few on a cookie sheet and BAM! fresh baked cookies any time. Just don't let your freezer turn ugly, make sure to have a list of what's in there and don't let it sit too long.

{"text":"Tonight we are having chicken and rice (it's cooking as I type). African chicken: make a mixture of 2 tblsp apricot jam, 4 tblsp Worcestershire sauce, 4 tblsp tomato ketchup, 2 tsp powdered ginger, 3 tsp mustard powder and half a fresh onion, all blended together into a thick sauce/ marinade. Dunk 12 chicken drumsticks into the mixture and lay in an oiled baking dish. Spoon the remaining sauce over them and bake at 180/ 200 C for about an hour. The chicken should be dark and sticky but not burnt, and the sauce should be thickened. Serve with steamed rice and a green vegetable such as broccoli or green beans. If you want to use another cut of chicken, that should work but you may need to adjust the cooking time and temperature. If you don't have tomato ketchup, relish or even passata would do. I don't know what prices for food are like in Europe, but here in Australia I would be looking at well under $20 for the chicken, broccoli, and rice. It's harder to budget for the sauce ingredients, which you may or may not have on hand.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1511855843}}

Sometimes, she would serve it with some red beans on the side, which would make it even more flavorful in her case. Here is a recipe I found: Prep Time: 5 minutes Cook Time: 28 minutes Ready In: 33 minutes Yields: 6 servings Ingredients: 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons sofrito 1/2 cup tomato sauce 1 small onion, chopped 1 clove garlic, minced 2 chorizo sausages, sliced into 1/2 inch rounds 2 cups long grain rice 2 1/2 cups water Salt and ground black pepper Directions: 1. In a medium sauce pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat until hot but not smoking. Stir in the sofrito, tomato sauce, onions, and garlic; cook and stir until the onions begin to soften, about 3 minutes. 2. Add the chorizo and continue to cook and stir for 5 minutes. Stir in the rice and water. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cover with a tight fitting lid. Reduce heat to low and simmer until all of the water is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 20 minutes.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1343358949"}}

If you always cook for small parties (2 to 6 people), invite 10, to 20 people. This increases the pressure and ultimately you rise to the occasion. This gives you a glimpse of what you have in a professional kitchen (customer satisfaction, logistics, long hours, even though the real McCoy is 1000000 times the pressure). If you always do savoury dishes, practice some deserts. Bakery and pastry are much less forgiving. If you do both already, cocktails ! Use \"weird\" ingredients etc... - never stay on a failure. If you mess up something (happens to everyone), do it again and again (maybe not in a row). Also like many people here I also spend time researching things and try to get to know the ingredients.

But it also prevents hot spots so you get a more even cook on top, and will also cook the bottom a bit which usually isn't a bad thing.

Use a thermometer to tell you when the meat is cooked to your liking. I go medium-well for ground beef. I throw the cheese on after I remove the burgers from the pan.

Most of these do not require any pre-cooking, but I can't vouch for how these all come out. I recommend using your judgement when it comes to seasoning. Also, based on my experience, skip anything that contains pork chops. They dry out super easy in a slow cooker. There are definitely some \"sheet pan\" meals out there that can be prepped in advance and frozen as well, like this one with pork tenderloin, asparagus and sweet potato. This chicken one is pretty good too. > The less knife work I need to do the better as well. Definitely ask your butcher to trim, cut, or otherwise prepare your meat in the manner you want it for your recipes. Also, there's no shame in relying on frozen veggies, which are usually cut to a good size for roasting on a sheet pan. I joke with my husband that every veggie I had until adulthood either came out of a can or a bag in the freezer, and we still use a lot of frozen vegetables today.

All had great recipes but I was only making food paint-by-numbers style - I never felt like I was actually cooking. I picked up Food Lab on a whim like I had every other cookbook but I have to say that I've referenced it more as a manual than a collection of recipes. Learning how to cut an onion, why you mix ingredients in a particular order, the water retention in meats using different cooking methods/times, the purpose of different types of knives, benefits of cooking with different types of meats/beads/vegetables, when to use what heat with what oils, etc. I never really used the other cookbooks because I didn't know why I was doing each step. My fiance and I cook together more now than we ever have before. All that said, everything is online. I typically only use the Food Lab book now to learn a new technique or if I don't understand a new recipe. Most recipes and intros I read online. In OP's defense, I typically rebel against every new fad out there just because I hate hearing everyone yap about it.

{"text":"You have just discovered a really tasty part of poultry that many overlook or get turned off to. I love these things. First, always give them a real good wash/rinse. Secondly, due to the large amount of connective tissue in gizzards, I find they either need to be cooked at higher heats (roasting, grilled) or cooked longer and slower. Hearts not as much, but they can be very chewy if cooked poorly. Both are very flavorful, almost the essence of whatever poultry they belong to (chicken/turkey, etc) Here's how I cook and eat both: Try tossing in salt/pepper/garlic and baking in a ramekin or on a sheet. I prefer the ramekin option. Boiled (for 20 minutes) and chopped or shredded fine they make a really nice addition to the appropriate poultry gravy, or even in a nice mashed potato. Save the water you boil them in for stuffing moistener or for stock or soup later. Summertime, I like gizzards and hearts on a skewer, marinated in anything that strikes your fancy, I tend to like garlicky or peppery marinades for 24 hours. Eat them right off a stick. I've sliced the gizzards lengthwise and used them in stir-fry, or as long shreds in soup, ramen style!","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1447716897"}}

People initially like what they like because of what they've been exposed to and consider \"normal\" and later on what they train themselves to like. My 4 year old nice Norwegian niece doesn't mind the taste of cod liver oil at all (you have to experience this first hand to know the horror) and things like blood food might be common in some cultures, but would shock in others. Nobody likes their first beer, glass of red wine or taste of dark chocolate.

{"text":"Still not sure what the budget is, etc. Also not sure how much prep time you'll have. Or what culinary level is expected (low-brow camp cooking?). 1. Grilled veggies (squash, eggplant, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, asparagus, etc). For squash and eggplant, slice into grillable pieces, salt them moderately with kosher salt, let sit 20 minutes, then wipe off liquid. Hit w/Pepper, other seasonings if you want, then grill over high coals until cooked but still firm. For mushrooms, peppers, etc: cut, skewer (or use a grill wok), then hit w/ S&amp;P and balsamic vinegar. Let sit 20 mins. Brush/spray with oil, then grill at high heat until done. I like them just like this, but some people like to marinate them again after cooking before eating. 2. While veggies are sweating/marinating, grill your protein and prep your sauce (if grill plain meats or dry-rubbed meats). Marinated chicken breasts are easy and forgiving if they stay on the grill a bit too long. Burgers are easy. Fish is easy... use firm fish and cook in a foil packet with S&amp;P, onion, garlic, a splash of wine, and lemon juice. Easy cleanup. For sauces when camping, I like to rehydrate crushed/chopped dried berries in wine/water with herbs, salt, chiles, then reduce. Thicken via reduction, cheat a little with corn starch if needed. This takes a minimum of 45 minutes... so if you really only have 30 minutes, just heat up some already prepped sauce. 3. Specialties. Every grill cook should have a few easy ones that have wide appeal. 3a. Caramelized sweet onion cooked in foil is one of mine. Take a sweet onion (Maui/Vidalia/etc), take off papery layers, slice in eight or sixteen sections -- but do not cut through the root, it needs to keep it's shape. Thin slices of butter between sections, then hit with salt and your preferred herbs/spices. For fish, I like to use Old Bay on the onion. For beef, I use thyme and rosemary. Wrap tightly in 2 layers of foil, then grill on high heat, turning over twice. Finish direct on the coals. Open and eat immediately. Use foil packet, not cookware, or you'll spend a long time scrubbing. Some people like to add a beef buillon cube instead of salt. Me no likey, but it tastes kind of like french onion soup if you do this. Note this takes 45 minutes or so also. 3b. Potato and onion packet. Peel and cube potatoes. Slice onions. Toss with S&amp;P, herbs. Put em in a foil packet. Dab with butter. Seal packet. Grill until done. Simple, perfect. Cook time roughly 20-25 minutes depending on size of cubes. 3c. Cornbread. Google a recipe for campfire cornbread. Try a few. Use indirect heat if you can. Make sure to not preheat the pan too much. 4. Beans. Lentils cook quickly, are filling, and nutritious. Excellent side for most anything. Dice carrots, celery, onion. Saute until soft. Add garlic. Move onto lower fire. Add herbs. Add rinsed lentils, cover with hot water, bring to boil, simmer 20 minutes or so until lentils are tender but still hold their shape. Seriously, you need to figure out what you're comfortable with in terms of camp cooking, and work from there.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1355356205"}}

You can do something like a large chuck roast (I don't know what size cooker you got, so pick an appropriate size), a roughly chopped onion, some baby yukon gold potatoes, baby carrots, sliced mushrooms, garlic and some dried thyme in there.

For lunch and dinner, soups are a very good idea. You can even get a sliced loaf, cut the crusts off and dip the bread in the soup to get it really soft and have that alongside the soup to fill you up a little more. I suggest erring on the side of creamy soups (cream of chicken, broccoli and stilton, cream of vegetable) and away from anything acidic like tomato or spicy soups in case they sting your wounds. Overcooked pasta or other noodles with smooth sauce will give you some variety, as will other sloppy foods like chilli, shepherd's pie &amp; soft casseroles. Having puddings and little snacks will keep your calorie intake up if you're struggling -- things like jelly and ice cream and rice pudding are all soft and easy to eat.

Just remember that spending a bit more on food is worth it in the long run if you can avoid developing diabetes. How restricted are you going to go with carbs? I mean, if you're going keto, then your options will be severely limitted to pretty much meat, cheese, berries, and non-starchy vegetables, but if you can afford 100+ g carbs per day then starchy vegetables, fruits, and whole grains become easier to include. The latter foods are much cheaper than the former, and you'll spend less. Source: I did keto for a few months. My food bills rose about 40%.

If you're making steaks for 3 to 4+ people, I don't think that each additional steak adds linearly to the amount of time invested into the meal. I mean, at one point in my life, I might try to push my own methods into people, but some people just aren't open to that, and they will like what they like, even if they are ultimately and forever missing out on a more intricate, subtle, and dilectable type of enjoyment. But maybe that person isn't intelligent enough to ever even fathom more subtle flavors. Maybe they've burned out their taste buds on high-fructose corn syrup, salt-bombs, and Bud Light pisswater. So they probably wouldn't get anything out of that craft you put into it anyhow. So yeah, I would be saddened, annoyed, disappointed, and frustrated if someone did that to a perfect steak I cooked, but if they are a guest in my home, I'll swallow that down and just be happy to make them feel welcome, since to me, that would be more important than them experiencing anything about my craft. They aren't doing it on purpose to slight you, if they do. Just let em.

And it is not to say we don't have seasons - we do... but they are plant seasons. And that, of course, changes the smells in the air, which trees are in bloom, etc. And not all of the smells are great - during guava season, there is so much guava and it just drops and rots... very fermented. And don't get me going on durian season :) Of course, things like the ocean change too - getting a bit too cold for enjoyable swimming in the winter (though that doesn't stop anyone). As per things like butternut squashes (and other types) - we enjoy those throughout the year. One positive thing here is that for some items, planting season is \"whenever you planted them\". So, for example, we get corn year-round.

{"text":"I\u2019ve been to a couple Michelin Star restaurants. Manresa, which was very very good, very very expensive, and had a lot of pomp and circumstance. I liked the meal, but not enough to return. The other restaurant is a lot more interesting - Lazy Bear in SF. It started as an underground pop-up. I found out about them through an underground farmer\u2019s market (god I sound like a hipster but I live in the burbs and just want to try all the food) where they were serving this egg dish that was beyond delicious, started following them and then got tickets to one of their dinners. I would call it gourmet food with paper napkins. Casual (jeans and a shirt) environment, you kept one fork for the whole meal (they suggest just giving it a lick as prep for the next course), communal tables, and course after course of amazing food. After several years, several meals (including a brunch I still dream about) they went legit and opened a brick and mortar restaurant. Prices went waaaay up - I think it was about 65-80/person at the pop up and now I think it\u2019s hovering around 150-200/person. I have eaten at their legit restaurant twice and I have to say it\u2019s just as good as it was before, you just get more forks. Still pretty casual, but that\u2019s pretty typical for SF. I feel very fortunate to have been able to eat with them so many times both before and after they \u201cmade it\u201d. I would absolutely love to try The French Laundry one day, but besides more meals at Lazy Bear, I don\u2019t have any huge burning desires to seek out any more Michelin starred restaurants. I think finding locals who know the food scene who can point you to some up-and-coming restaurants is probably the way to go.

Harina means flour, masa does not just mean dough, it is a truncation of the phrase masa de maiz. Further, coriander and cilantro ARE the same thing. Some parts of the world call every part of the plant coriander, sometimes fresh coriander or Mexican parsley when talking about the leaves. You'll see this disambiguation a lot in Indian and French recipes. And, yes, the seeds and leaves taste and smell different. Thanks for explaining that.

{"text":"the way you learn to cook is: start making a menu. There is shit that you eat all the damn time (unless it doesnt involve actual cooking). Maybe there is somethig you like from a restaurant. even a fast food restaurant. Figure ouot a bunch of things you really like to eat. Stuff that you wouldnt mind eating once a week. Once you've written all these things down, you are ready to start. Pick one of these things. This is what you will perfect. You will cook this and nothing else until you are damn well satisfied with it. You wont need to look at the recipe, you wont need to worry about \"i dont have X ingredient, so now what do i do\". By the time you can consider yourself confident in cooking this thing, you will be able to walk into anyone's kitchen, throw together the ingredients, maybe even do some makeshift substitutions or spruce it up on the fly, and serve it. It doesnt matter what this first thing you pick is. It could be eggs. It could be an omlette. It could be a cake (you fatass, eating cake every week). But just pick something you like. I started with hardboiled eggs. My parents burn then every time. They are chalky and gross. So i was like screw it, im going to learn and do it right. And i did. Not necessarily on everyone's stove, but i know on mine i can set the water to high, pop in 2 eggs in water, and in 8 minutes they will be exactly how i want them. in 10 they will be hard boiled properly rather than ever so slightly gooey in the middle. I also did Japanese Curry (kare). The recipe is on the back of the box. I put my own spin on it and made it every week. Now i can add whatever i want. I know how every single ingredient works in every single condition (too much water, too much curry cubes, various ingredients instead of my usual chicken potato onion carrot bell pepper). I did tacos/burritos. you brown meat, drain it, pop in a can of your favorite chili, and simmer until desired consistency is reached. Add whatever toppings you want. Now lets say you want to discover more recipes. How do you pick a recipe? The way i do it is, i look at various people cooking. Lets take prime rib, for example. I go to the main sources: alton brown, gordon ramsey, chef john from foodwishes. I figure out how they do it, what their methods all have in common. Then i look at other peoples' recipes and see what they do. Some use a dry rub, some just use salt+pepper, etc. Then i figure out what i want to do. I combine all of those methods that i liked and cook things my way. If im not feeling so ballsy, i pick one of my favorite chefs and use their method to a T. The first time i cook something, it isnt 100% perfect. it never is. Thats a fact of life. But by the 4th or 5th time i cook it, its perfect. And when i say perfect, i dont mean the family doesnt like it. I mean everyone loves it but i know in my heart and mind that its missing something. I'm EXTREMELY critical of the food i cook. Some stuff i dont give a shit about. like burritos. But other stuff, specifically stuff im cooking for other people, i tear myself a new one in critique if i dont like the way it turns out.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1355469588"}}

You were right that everything needs to be fully cooked before going into the quiche. Any significant amount of water not cooked out of your veggies will find its way into the filling, as will the fat that hasn't rendered out of your meat. Without knowing your egg/dairy ratio, it's hard to judge, but it's possible your recipe is just off. I started with a basic recipe that used 2 eggs per cup of milk, and usually ended up with a tiny bit of water lying on top of the quiche. Then one time, I started mixing up some quiche without realizing I didn't have enough milk, so I replaced half of it with sour cream, and that solved my watery problem and improved the texture considerably. (It also considerably upped the calorie count, but IMO it's worth it!)

(it also has a low smoke point meaning it's bad on both counts.) if you use it once in a way it probably won't hurt much say a couple of times a month. same for butter/cheese - dont cook in those and eat occasionally. similarly omega6 rich oils like soybean, safflower, grapeseed, regular (linoleic) sunflower oil are better avoided because of inflammation. you can see the contents of oils here in the second table: https://veganhealth.org/omega-3s-part-4/ the second criteria is smoke point - the temperature at which oils smoke and turn carcinogenic. oils with low smoke points are best avoided for cooking especially moderate to high temperature cooking. you can add them as a finishing oil though for their taste (like EVOO). generally unrefined oils also tend to be lower smoke points. so the good ones are canola, peanut, rice bran, avocado, \"high oleic\" sunflower oil. they are low-moderate in omega6s, low in saturated fats. high in MUFAs and have high smoke points","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1553507950}}

{"text":"If you really don't have the room, I would pick the toaster oven. If you cook in batches, you can freeze servings and pop them in the toaster oven. It would be as convenient as the microwave but not as quick. But you just preheat the oven, wait, pop it in, and then do something else. I agree with someone else who suggested getting an extra big cutting board to go over the sink so you such extra space. [Something like this]( http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=over%20the%20sink%20cutting%20board). You'll still be able to rinse and stuff but you'll be able to utilize the space above the sink. I also recommend a slow cooker, which can do the cooking for you while you're at work. However, considering it's so small, I highly doubt the counters have actual stone. If you plan on using a toaster oven or slow cooker, it might get hot enough to damage the counter and be a fire hazard. If you shop for a slow cooker on Amazon, some of the reviewers mention that it scorched/melted laminate. Since they both are heat sources you might not be minding the entire time, it's something you should keep in mind.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1374090635"}}

This cuts down the cooking time significantly, and they'll generally not need the meat to be browned. Now, that's not *always* the case - there's a number of dishes in Chinese food at least that want you to stir fry the meat before braising. *Dapanji* ('big plate of chicken') springs to mind.

{"text":"There's something psychological at play here. Your ego is overriding your love for your partner. Not necessarily a bad thing, just a mechanical thing, which is extremely common and also easy to fix when you recognize it. Anyone who loves cooking is heavily invested in it as part of who they are. We live and breathe food. It's on our minds all the time. And the dark side of it is that when our loves and hobbies determine aspects of our personality we can also judge others. For example, if you have a strong opinion about someone who eats well done steaks with ketchup lol But in all honesty it's very trivial, right? A person's food preference. We are artists and culinary integrity is in our souls. Some people don't speak the language and it's not on them. So the complex act of cooking for your loved one, you need to split it apart. You don't need to inject culinary integrity into every act of cooking. The slight resentment you feel is actually that judgment that comes as the result of our obsession with food. Feeding your loved one should go in a different bucket, the fulfillment of doing something for them the way they like and making them happy. So if your partner just wants a kid's meal, make that kids meal, plate it nicely, get two small cups for ranch and bbq and just bask in the admiration of your partner gleefully and appreciatingly eating something you prepared, whether it's up to your standards or not. You can talk to us in the language of Food, and your partner in the language of Love. All the best","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1550791924}}

{"text":"From the Food Safety Notebook: \"Vegetables, herbs, and fruits are likely to have some degree of soil contamination, especially those that grow on or under the ground. Soil contamination introduces the possibility that C botulinum spores may be added as an unwelcome ingredient in a recipe. If the produce is put into an anaerobic environment, such as a container of oil, Botulism Toxin can be produced and botulism may result upon consumption. Several cases of botulism involving garlic-in-oil preparations brought this hazard to light in the 1980's. In 1985, Vancouver, BC, 37 people got botulism from a garlic-in-oil preparation. This was followed by a 1988 laboratory investigation into the survival of and toxin production by C botulinum in garlic-in-oil preparations. In 1989, 3 people in Kingston, NY, became ill, also from a garlic-in-oil infusion. Thus, in 1989 the FDA issued a ruling, ordering the removal from store shelves of all commercial garlic-in-oil preparations that lacked an acidifying agent, followed by a mandate requiring the addition of an acidifying agent (such as phosphoric or citric acid) to all commercial garlic-in-oil preparations. Acid prevents the growth of the C botulinum, so any spores that might be present in an infusion will not be able to flourish and produce toxin. The acid must be added as the recipe is being prepared.\" TL;DR: Raw garlic is is dirty, oil isn't acidic enough to kill bacteria, so don't put the two together and store at room temperature.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1344001429"}}

{"text":"Separate the eggs before \"boiling\" the whites. Place about 6 whites in a good quality ziplock bag, removing all the air by submerging the bag to the ziplock line as you seal it. This is really easy once you start doing it and see how water pressure conforms the bag to the whites. 172F is your target temperature, if you have a thermometer (and you really should, even a cheap one works for this sort of thing), hold at 172F for about 15 minutes and peel your perfectly cooked egg whites from their bag whenever is convenient over the next few days. Without a thermometer, my best guess would be to bring 6 cups of water to a boil, dip out 3 1/2 cups and add 3 cups of bath warm hot water to it then add the egg whites (splitting the 212F of boiling with the 110ish F of hot bath water to be about 172F). Add about 3/4C of boiling water every 5 minutes to maintain the heat, but really just buy a thermometer if after one try you like the method. Extra egg yolks around here, and especially in the spring when asparagus beckons, become hollandaise.

{"text":"If often wondered why it's always Chili (con Carne?) that is subject to these cook-offs. In my opinion it is something that is incredibly easy to make. Mine is off course awesome. Last time I made it with braised beef and pork shredded like pulled pork. You could try that. Basically get a nice chunk of pork (I don't know the names of the cuts in English that well) and same amount of beef, also one piece (i.e. not minced) Get your skillet out and brown these bad boys on each side in some duck fat or equally awesome fat. Then put those in your chili pot and add some beer, stock and other liquids you think will work. Then chop of the veggies and give them a good fry on the skillet (I sometimes use a little celery), add the dried spices and chilies (I use a variety of mild habaneros for aroma and hotter ones for heat - use the peppers you like) and tomatoes either canned or fresh. I like chunky chili so I'll use whole skinned canned tomatoes and roughly chopped onions etc. Put in a little brown sugar or dark syrup. A piece of very dark chocolate does good too. Use what ever beans you like. Some Worcester sauce wouldn't hurt either though it is not exactly traditional. As for spices I use paprika, cayenne, oregano, onionpowder (can be omitted), black pepper, salt, monosodiumglutamate (if you have it) and most important of all cumin. You could put some ground coriander in as well but be careful. Use some limejuice or vinegar if acidity is needed. If you slowcook for five or six hours it the meat will eventually fall apart but after 1 and a half or two you can pick out the chunks of meat and pull them apart with a couple of forks. I used a Kitchen Aid table mixer to pull the meat. It works great for that. Once shredded nicely put it back in the pot and let it reduce until you think it's right. I wouldn't hesitate on serving with some chopped coriander leaves ('Muricans call it cilantro) with a spoonful of sour cream or creme fraiche. OK, it's a little messy but should give you a basic idea of what you could do.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1392310114"}}

{"text":"I used to have a really hard time with this as well. For a lighter roux, favor the butter. It keeps the mixture fluid, evenly distributes heat, and there is always time in the first few minutes to go to the pantry for more flour. A light roux must be done on the stove top, because color and more importantly, smell are crucial in deciding when to pull it. A darker roux, imo, is much easier. You can use an equal amount of butter and flour(or favor flour for an even darker roux) and move to the oven @~350, preferably convection. Even heat from all sides does wonders for a dark roux. The oven takes longer but offers a much greater margin of error with a darker roux. Once the roux is the right color, add your liquid until the viscocity feels right to you. Guard against adding to much liquid because if the mix thickens further in the cooking process, you can always add more liquid, but you can only take liquid out by standing in front of the stove, staring at a watched pot boiling. As for the cheese... just make sure its not pre-shredded.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1459737654}}

I started trying to make a foundation and just ended up cluttering my cupboard with a bunch of crap I never use (e.g. tarragon, dill, coriander, saffron, etc.). Not that those spices don't have uses, but I rarely use them. You'll find that you only really use maybe ten spices on a regular basis but the only way to know what those are is to cook and see what you need. That said, a good start would be oregano, thyme, rosemary, sage, ground cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, paprika and garlic powder. Wait what, no parsley, cilantro or basil? No, these are *much* better fresh. Most spices are better fresh, but some are much betterer than others to the point that you shouldn't use the freeze dried versions unless it's a cooking emergency and Gordon Ramsey is threatening to disembowel your kids for undercooking the scallops. Generally the ones that need to be fresh are the very leafy, wet climate ones.

{"text":"You should try out a recipe from my sister-in-law for Mexican Poached Egg Tacos. It takes all the difficulty out of poaching eggs with the simple trick of poaching them in salsa. Let me explain: Per Person: *3 eggs * 3 small corn tortillas * half an avocado * a bit o' cilantro * Refried Beans (optional) * A bunch of chunky salsa Method: Take a large skillet or sauce pot and fill with enough salsa to cover the bottom. Turn on medium-high heat until the salsa is bubbling. Then use a ladle or wooden spoon to create 3-4 divots in the salsa chunks. In the meantime, cut up your avocado into slices and chop some cilantro. If you want refried beans, get them heating up too. CAREFULLY crack and pour an egg into each divot. Cover the pot with a lid and let them poach for 5-6 minutes or so. Watch them, you'll know when it's time to go when the white of the egg has just fully covered the yolk. If you want them less runny, since I know you don't like eggs, just let them go a minute or two longer. When ready, scoop refried beans onto each corn tortilla and place an egg on top. Top with some of the poaching salsa, avocado, and cilantro and enjoy! These get messy, so bring a napkin. Hope this helps!","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1430172553"}}

Number one thing to remember is get your steel pan HOT before you add your fat/oil. The pores close and it won't stick as bad as if you just put food in right away. Plus, delicious delicious pan sauces. Next a kitchen aid food processor is a great thing to have. It comes with a large bowl and a small insert bowl. Shredder attachment, slicer attachment and a dough blade for bread. Along the mixer side get a stick blender. They cost ~$30 and can be used for so much stuff that is not feasible in a food processor. Quick dressing for a salad, chimichury for steak, frozen margerita after dinner, another after that! Also get a good quality pepper mill and keep it filled. Once you have tried fresh ground pepper you will never go back to pre ground again. The bible: its been around for 75 years and is still the best thing to have. Of course I'm talking about The Joy of Cooking. Don't get the newest version get the 1997 re release.

So for (say) deep frying, or hot wok-frying stir fry, reach for the vegetable/canola/peanut oil; but your average sautee or roasted vegetables or whatnot, olive oil is fine. 2. Extra-virgin olive oil DOES have a low smoke point, and should mainly not be used in heat applications. 3. (This I had to realize myself) If you put something in the oven at 400, it doesn't mean everything within that oven gets to 400 degrees. The oil drizzled on top of your pizza, or cooking your roasted whatever, isn't that hot. It's frequently still below the olive oil smoke point.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1465280686}}

{"text":"Lots of great advice here. Do you have a thermometer in your oven to make sure it's cooking at the correct temperature? I had this problem for years with just about everything and my oven was cycling incorrectly. It didn't matter what I did to the recipe. Outside of that, adding a little buttermilk or cream of tartar to decrease the pH might reduce your browning a bit so you can cook them long enough to get done without burning. Also, just turning the temperature down about 25 degrees (f) and/or adjusting your rack position also might help. If you're browning to much on top, move it down, and vice versa. Last, make sure the muffins don't cool in a way that will cause them to steam. So not in their tins or wrapped in any way. A rack is best. This way the excess moisture can evaporate off the outside. Edit: After rereading this, I can't tell what you currently are experiencing. You want browning, but not burnt. So I read that as you currently are getting them too brown before the inside is done and you're trying to balance the inside and outside cooking, so that's what my advice is based on. Not sure if that's what you want.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1375083583"}}

If started in cold water, one would have to stir until the water was boiling to prevent sticking.

{"text":"I buy a store brand loaf of whole wheat bread that costs about $1.70. I don't think it would be a significant savings for my family to bake all of our bread. I'm looking at bread consumption rather than just one loaf compared to one loaf though. When I bake bread for my (not obese) family the loaf is gone in a day. When I buy a loaf of bread it lasts at least a week. So I would need to bake a lot more bread to have bread in my home daily. I bake bread and rolls to go with specific dishes or because I feel like having it. A $5 bag of the cheapest white flour is $1.69 for me. If I have to use it up and other ingredients and my time to bake and clean up after to make 6 or so loaves of bread a week it does not seem so economical. If you barely eat any bread then baking a loaf occasionally could cost you less than buying a similar loaf at the store.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1549726082}}

Key word is limited. The thermal radiation produced by the body is extremely miniscule. It's the same with food. For there to be enough thermal radiation to be worth reflecting, the heat would already be high enough to turn any food into ash. Edit: After some more research, it seems that there's a roughly 1% difference between the dull side and the shiny side in certain cooking applications. It's up to you if you determine if this enough to affect how you use your foil.

I don't know how \"oniony\" your sauce tastes, but onion is one of the big base flavors in most western soups - I saw that your sauce recipe called for essentially steeping the onion then removing it. I think you'll have to make a call on this one, my wild guess is that you would want a little bit more onion base for a soup. I would add chicken stock, and yes it will change the taste a bit, but to make it into a classic tomato soup you also need to bring in some other flavors like carrot and basil. Just tomato sauce + chicken broth is going to be a little bland.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1366322670"}}

{"text":"Copper is pretty and has useful properties but if your able to persuade them to high quality stainless, you should for their sake and your wallet. All-clad makes the best cookware, and seeing that you are buying copper already, you likely have a bit of cash to spend. Any higher end restaurant or large cash flow food service operation uses the standard \u201ccommercial\u201d line of all clad, they call it MC2. Here is the link: https://www.all-clad.com/Collection/mc2_collection . Start with the 12in fry pan and work your way down. Second in line and a lot of restaurants use only this type of pan as it\u2019s durable, cheaper than All-clad and it\u2019s ability to be non stick is blue or black steel, https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B000K9FKC4/ref=sspa_mw_detail_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 . These are raw steel, they care called blue, black or carbon steel depending on the manufacture. They only make this kind in saut\u00e9 pan \u201cshape\u201d but even if you give a copper piece for Christmas, it would be really nice to give this guy as well and will surly become their go to pan used daily. Other then all-clad they use the typical all purpose Vollrath or Don brand cookware which you wouldn\u2019t want to use st home anyway. Mauviel products are top of the line copper cookware, if a restaurant had to use copper for some reason, this is what they would buy. It\u2019s heavy weight, copper is soft and bends really easy, so the heavier it is, the strength is from reinforced steel layers. You can find it all over, google search it but do your homework as it\u2019s pretty expensive and a 10-15% off coupon might go a long way. Their heritage collection is extremely sturdy and what I\u2019ve seen in commercial use but it was a 2 star Michelin restaurant and we used it for saucing table side, displaying fish (like sole) to be portioned table side or large items like roast duck or chicken. The items were never cooked in these pans, just for display. We did have a few 4-6-8qt copper pots with triple thick bottoms that we used for reducing liquids that burned easy or scorched, but a typical pot is fine if your not in a hurry. Look for cast iron handles vs stainless steel if you are looking for long term use. They both are, cast iron will add weight to an already heavy pan but it\u2019s virtually indestructible. My self and other chefs that I\u2019ve worked with also like the feel and style of the cast iron handle but if we had to use it all night long for 4-5 hours daily... we would prefer stainless to cut down on weight. The biggest thing that you should look for is brushed copper versus polished. You will spend a lot of time cleaning the outside of this pan from hard water marks, finger prints or any oil residue left behind while the brushed looks just as good but easier to maintain. Take a look at this web page: http://www.falkusa.com/falk-copper-cookware-frying-saute-pans , it\u2019s easier to see the brushed look on this cookware versus other websites. Falk is a good brand as well, they can be a bit more expensive as they are a smaller company and their pan weight is a bit more then most. Most chefs tend to avoid this brand because if they saut\u00e9 / fry pan line. The sides of the pan are much taller then typical pans and the angle of the edge is smaller making it a little bit harder to maneuver or \u201cflip\u201d items in the pan by a flick of the wrist. Key points: -shop around: coupons and Black Friday deals save big time. -brushed over polished -cast iron handle over stainless - weight: if it feels like it\u2019s lighter then it should and it\u2019s price is cheap when not on sale, it\u2019s likely garbage. -avoid sets: they will try to justify a higher price by giving you more pans but how likely are you to use a 1/4 quart sauce pan or crepe pan. -warranty: most will have a lifetime warranty on them for manufacturing defects which is great. But, their warranty policy is likely worded very well to guard themself from miss use from the consumer which is more likely to happen vs traditional cookware. -introduce the blue/black steel fry pan with the copper set, a 8 or 9.5in pan will be these best $40 spent. -don\u2019t be fooled into buying covers for all these pans. They typically can\u2019t be displayed and hold no value being copper. **\u00a5** most importantly.... do not buy copper cookware that is 100% copper on the outside and inside. It\u2019s easy to bend and break, tarnishes easy which can get into your food or the chemicals used to clean the inside get in your food. Almost any utensil used to mix or stir will scratch or nick it. The only pot that is suppose to be 100% copper is the sugar pot. It\u2019s used to get the temperature of liquid hot sugars to an exact temperature for the use in candies. Fluctuating a few degrees when it comes to hot liquid sugar is the difference between soft or hard candy or regular or caramelized sugar. There is no other use for such a pan and it would be a waste of money or the item has been electrically copper coated for show. They typically look like this: https://www.amazon.com/Mauviel-MPassion-2194-18-2-Quart-Saucepan/dp/B0002L5GIS/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543088781&amp;sr=8-5&amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&amp;keywords=copper+sugar+pot&amp;dpPl=1&amp;dpID=31SBSQ3A3JL&amp;ref=plSrch , so you\u2019ll be able to spot them. On the flip side to all of this... my mother has a set of \u201cCopper Chef\u201d cookware that she got off the tv or bed bath &amp; beyond. The whole set is like $140-$150 so it\u2019s pretty reasonable. I know it sounds cheesy, and gimmicky and just crap cookware but I\u2019ve used it many times now and for in home use... it\u2019s good. Would I buy it for my kitchen? No, sadly I would be shamed from the culinary community and I can be pretty hard on cookware. But my mother cooks daily, they have a $300k kitchen with top of the line everything, full set of all clad, Viking rages... you name it, it\u2019s there. But in the end she prefers to use the copper chef stuff, so it all depends on the user. Good luck!

{"text":"Is it the BBQ you\u2019re trying to stay away from or the buffet line? Because the buffet line, at least for the entrees and sides, is kind of the key to doing this frugally. And avoiding BBQ isn\u2019t terribly hard. Coq Au Vin is a great simple way to use chicken thighs, especially if you want something to prep in advance. When done properly you\u2019d actually be cooking it the day before and just skimming the excess fatout of the sauce and reheating it the day of. I also imagine braising is a fairly easy thing to do in quantity. There are a ton of other flavors you can get with the chicken through braising as well. Chicken picatta shouldn\u2019t be too difficult aside from pounding out that many thighs. With the pork I generally go one of three directions with shoulder. Either the simple pulled pork BBQ, down a Mexican route, or down an Asian route. For the latter two there are just so many options it really depends what you like. You could also go the route of the pulled pork bbq but keep the pork unsauced and provide a selection of sauces and rolls and toppings to dress it up. Another option that isn\u2019t really fancier but would be a lot of fun, is a taco (and possibly sandwich bar). You can lay out assorted toppings, sauces, and tortillas/bread, and give options to make Mexican style tacos, again style tacos and sandwiches, or pulled pork BBQ. There\u2019s definitely a good bit of overlap in ingredients, and a simple chicken and pork could work in all three. Again, maybe not what you\u2019re looking for, but fun. But really there are just far too many options. We\u2019re going to need a little bit more direction to provide any more specific advice. Good luck!","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1519329387}}

(or any ethnicity, i'm just using indian food as an example because i really want paneer tikka right now) basically, people can cook whatever they want. authenticity is stupid unless you're trying to pass something obviously not authentic (god i hate that word) as 'authentic,' like barbecue tikka masala ;X (gross!). as long as you're not being an obtuse asshole about it i think it's fine!!!","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1548792673}}

I'm a pretty experienced baker and I feel like it takes a lot of successful baking in order to get to a point where you can start messing with recipes. Some recipes are easier than others to tweak. Scones are incredibly flexible. Once you have the base recipe down you can get pretty creative with the add-ins. Oatmeal cookies are equally flexible. Cakes, not so much. Generally speaking, you can easily mess around with the flavor of the baked good and be successful. Adding vanilla and almond extract to a white cake recipe, for example. Or if you're making a pumpkin loaf, you can tweak the spices, and/or brown the butter. Use grapefruit peel instead of lemon. Cut back on the sugar in a frosting recipe. Add and extra cup of chocolate chips in the cookie batter. Swap brown sugar for white, substitute whole wheat flour for AP. Being lazy about measuring flour, guesstimating baking powder, not preheating your oven, and disregarding pan size will almost always be a disaster.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1408069486"}}

{"text":"By volume, true that those dishes will be lower calorie- but that is primarily an issue because the average serving size has grown tremendously over the past 2-3 decades. A McDonalds\u2019 hamburger, small (formerly \u201cregular\u201d) fries with 8-ounce soda was originally a full meal for an adult. Now, most people would consider it \u201ctoo small\u201d because they\u2019ve grown used to massive calorie bombs. When eaten in appropriate serving sizes, the taste of pasta, gnocchi, and breads can\u2019t be beat. For myself, I prefer the full-variety menu in proper proportion rather than a huge plate that leaves me feeling stuffed. Most American restaurants these days serve 2-3x what would be appropriate for a healthy diet. I think people have grown used to that, making it too easy to overeat while believing one is consuming a \u201cnormal\u201d volume.

That, and the contestants on Hell's Kitchen are not the most shining examples of skilled professionals. When they cook the dish, they've got a dozen other things not only to think about, but also to do. Not just that, but when the dish is fired, they've got to match it up with upwards of 4-5 other dishes going out. This creates problems and challenges. You have to communicate with other people who aren't extremely skilled at what they're doing, and rely on them to let you know how long it's taking them to complete their task. It's really not as simple as sticking it in the oven and taking it out when the timer beeps. It's more like - I've got 5 wellington on order, 4 fired, going with 3 lamb, just coming off my station. Now, I've also got to make sure that they finish exectly when 4 lobster, 6 scollop, and a vegetarian risotto. Oh, wait, in the middle of all of this, someone sent back a lamb I have to refire not because it was mistemped, but because it's a tv show and they scripted someone to send back food to test me on how I can adapt. And that isn't even a difficult rush for your normal everyday neighborhood bistro. So, while you may sit there and say to yourself, \"How difficult is that? I could do what they're doing.\" I assure you, the standard they're being asked to meet is one that far exceeds yours, and the sheer number of tasks they have to perform in the course of 20 minutes of a good rush in the kitchen exceeds the amount of tasks you perform in the average week in yours.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1358797136"}}

If you want to add extra stuff like that into the patty, you should add it when grinding. If you are buying ground beef from the grocery store, then you should skip that stuff. Its way too hard to incorporate extras without squishing your beef into paste. Start with just the beef. Shape the patties gently, and add salt just before cooking.

Also, knowing the flavor profiles always gives you room to experiment. Want more earthy flavors in a marinara, add mushrooms and more basil. Want your chicken to jump out? Marinate in lemon juice with basil. Then fry with lemon juice. Then add more lemon juice at serving. Lemon and chicken are married flavors. Want beef to jump? Sear the fat on its side before searing the meat. Butter baste with garlic. Want pork to jump? Make a rub of dry seasoning. Bake halfway. Then add a wet rub just as it begins to tenderize made of apple juice, lemon juice, and honey. See? Flavor profiles allow you to experiment as you can learn what ingredients alter or enhance the meal during the cooking. Vegetables love oil. Any oil. They also love to be baked as opposed to being boiled as boiling removes the natural flavor (Americans love bland food). You have great advice already.

For a Cajun gumbo, you usually want the roux to go pretty dark, like chocolate. You also want the onions nicely caramelized. Some people do this in a separate pan; some just add them to the main pan, but before the rest of the aromatic vegetables. For a Creole gumbo, you don't brown things as much, and you usually add some tomatoes. Now, for the seasonings, you can add some store-bought Cajun or Creole seasoning, or you can just add stuff to taste if you have a well-stocked pantry. I like cayenne, paprika (preferably smoked), black pepper, oregano, thyme, bay, Worcestershire sauce. Then add some chicken stock and let it simmer, and add whatever meats you want. If you are using multiple meats, add them at the right time so they all get done cooking simultaneously. You can also brown meats in advance for additional depth of flavor. Some people say a gumbo must contain okra. If you want it, throw it in to simmer along with the meat. If not, you might want to add some fil\u00e9 powder. Do this right before serving, preferably on the plate; heating fil\u00e9 makes it stringy.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1403689190"}}

This is not the kind of foie gras you would grill or pan fry. If it is bloc, I would suggest baking a really nice loaf of French bread and enjoying the pate spread directly on it. Maybe paired with fig jam, a sharp cheese, and a nice Riesling (or even a slightly chilled Beaujolais). Whole unprepared foie gras is usually sold either fresh (and highly perishable) or preserved in a very large jar in oil. If this is the case, you should read up on how to prepare and devein foie gras, IMHO the best serving is simply pan frying lightly and serving with good bread. Your suggestion of onion jam sounds really good, an unctuous sweet pairing usually works well with it.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1345141824"}}

{"text":"I don't use recipes as such. More a rule of thumb. BTW I didn't get Itaki but a less expensive brand via Amazon. In the bottom pot I put some kind of grain or noodle. I check the packaging to find out what the water ratio is. For instance, the bag says for white rice, 1/2 cup rice with 1 cup water. So that's what I put in the bottom pot. In the top dish I put some veg and usually some meat. Where I am right now, pork is cheap, so a few cubes of pork loin and some chunks of acorn squash work. Then I put some kind of sauce or seasoning. My favorite is sweet chili sauce. I also like to put pumpkin pie spice + cayenne pepper. Or tikka masala sauce. Just think of the flavors you like and go with it. Then put the water into the base and turn it on. The kit came with a plastic measuring cup, so I put two of those in the base. It's kind of trial and error how long it takes for the grain/noodle to cook, but by the time it is done, the stuff in the top is done too. Combine and enjoy. That's for lunch. For breakfast I put in hot cereal and water at the same ratio the package says in the bottom pot. If I want eggs, I spray cooking spray in the top dish and put a couple of eggs in. They get done fast, so I'm going to start leaving that for much later, after the cereal has had time to cook.

{"text":"Lived in Thailand for 8 years. here's some stuff. * the eggs are fine. Most of them seem to be pasteurized, if you don't get a fridge the trick to storing them longer than a week seems to be rotating them so they don't stick to the inside of the shell. You can test the freshness of eggs with a glass or bowl of water. an egg is good if it sits on the bottom of the water or one end of it still touches the bottom. An egg is bad when it floats. * buy fresh local greens and keep them in water. cilantro (pak chii), morning glory (pak boong/pak bung), spring onion (don hom) all work well this way. Also, Thai garlic (the purple-husked kind you may be seeing at the markets) is particularly good for storing in the open, I recommend just keeping it in a basket so the open air doesn't promote mold. Same deal for chili pepper and so on. * * Also explore the available dry ingredients. Dry shrimp, squid, cuttlefish, etc Gung haeng, blameuk haeng, etc. There are also a variety of pickles- pak dong, gratiam dong, king dong, etc. * the water machines are safe enough. Depending on the region of Thailand, the big issue is generally over-chlorination. The water machines typically work by exposing the light to UV <which kills the microbes>. I lived there 8 years, and drank a great deal of tap water- I am still here to tell of it. * * Once you have a more permanent place, if that's your goal, ask your neighbors about the local water delivery truck and pay the 20 baht or whatever it costs for a big bottle per week. it's probably way more than you'll need. * Get a refrigerator. You can get one for ~$50 US. it doesn't have to be the western shower stall size, it just has to keep your food fresh and beer cold (don't drink Chang, even acha is better, Federbrau is probably the best quality Thai beer, get Beer Lao if you can).

Grapeseed oil is about 15% monounsaturated, 70% polyunsaturated omega 6, and most of the remainder saturated. Some people are nervous about consuming a lot of omega 6 fats. It's not something I have an opinion on, but it's not going to be too hard to find people who will want to argue that grapeseed oil is actually unhealthy based on the fact that it's 70% omega 6. Safflower oil, canola oil, or even peanut oil would all be closer matches to olive oil in that they have large portions of monounsaturated fat with most of their polyunsaturated fats as omega 6.

Boil to 298. Add vanilla. Pour on a silpat and spread within 15 seconds. We then would coat each side of the brittle with choc and pecans. Are you at all at an altitude?

The USDA is not a credible source when it comes to cooking. They say all beef must be cooked to a minimum of 145, which is ridiculous. For decades they told us we had to cook our pork as if the US swine population was at risk of trichinosis, which was also ridiculous.

{"text":"I mixed up recipes from Jamie Oliver's Food Tube, Heston Blumenthal, and a couple of other Brits to create the following. It's a lot of work, but if you want delicious flavor, reasonable authenticity, and a full guide, use the below: ##Fish, Chips, &amp; Mushy Peas ###Ingredients * 4x Cod Filets (~4-6oz each; if frozen, thaw them out first) * ~1 1/2 tbsp Kosher Salt, divided * ~1 1/2 tsp Black Pepper, divided * 1 &amp; 1/2 cup AP Flour, divided * 1 tsp Baking Powder * 1 tbsp Honey * 12 oz bottle British Ale * ~1 - 1 1/2lb Russet Potatoes, sliced into thick rectangles (like steak fries) * 2 tbsp Unsalted Butter * 2 cups Frozen Peas * 1 tbsp Mint, minced * Water * 2 Lemons * Oil for deep frying (e.g. peanut, corn, sunflower, etc.) ###Directions Before starting anything else, add the thick-cut fries (as close to the same size as possible) to a large pot or dutch oven with enough water to cover by several inches and a couple of teaspoons of kosher salt. Bring the pot to a boil, then back off the heat to a gentle simmer and cook 3-5 minutes, until the fries are *just* cooked through and easily pierced by a toothpick. Carefully remove them from the water with a spider or spatula and place on a rack (set in a flat pan/cookie sheet to catch drips) and dry in the fridge, uncovered, 30 minutes or more. **You can skip this step if you don't want the hassle, but it makes for much better fries. If you skip it, do the \"second\" fry in hotter oil a little longer, instead.** Heat your frying oil to 325F. Working in batches, fry the french fries until just beginning to turn pale gold--probably 5 minutes, tops. Remove back to the rack and, for best results, chill in the fridge or freezer for another 30 minutes. You can actually freeze the fries at this stage in airtight baggies for quick frying in the future, so feel free to make a bunch! Whisk the baking powder into 1 cup of the flour, and throw that and the beer into your freezer for 10-15 minutes to chill out. The colder this batter is, the more it hangs onto the bubbles from the beer, and hence, the crispier your batter! For the peas, heat the butter in a small saucepan until melted and no longer fizzy. Add in your frozen green peas and stir to thaw them out and begin softening them. Toss in about a teaspoon of salt and up to 3/4 tsp of black pepper, along with the chopped mint leaves. Cook until the peas are noticeably softened and bright green. Add in a little water and mash the peas with a fork or potato masher, or to do it like they do on the streets, add a little *more* water and blend using an immersion blender! Feel free to make it as chunky or smooth as *you* like it. When you're ready to go, season your cod filets with give or take a teaspoon of kosher salt and 3/4 tsp of black pepper, covering both sides. Dredge them in the half cup of plain flour, shaking off the excess gently. Heat your frying oil to 375F. Working quickly, pour beer and honey into your chilled flour/baking powder mixture, whisking it together into a smooth, thin batter, about the texture of chowder or refrigerated \"faux\" syrup. You might not need quite all of the bottle of beer; feel free to drink the rest. Dip each cod fillet into the batter mixture, submerging it fully and then letting it drip just a little bit over the bowl. Transfer the filet into the hot oil, sliding it facing away from you to avoid splashing yourself with oil. For *extra crispy* fish, use a spoon to drizzle more batter over the top of each filet as it sizzles in the oil. After a minute or two, flip them to start browning the other side. Work in batches; depending on the size of your frying vessel, probably two at once at most. Once both sides of the fish is golden brown and very crispy (probably 4 minutes, tops), remove from the oil to drain on a rack over paper towels. Toss your fries into the hot oil for their second fry (or a long \"first fry\" if you skipped that step above), cooking about 2-3 minutes (or closer to 7) until golden brown and very crispy. As soon as they come out of the oil, toss them with salt. As you finish, spritz the juice of ~1/2 lemon (maybe a whole lemon if it's small) into the mushy peas, and cut the other lemon into wedges to serve on the side of your fish and chips.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1472742769}}

{"text":"I think that along with the specific type of garam masala or curry spice blend, part of the key to a \"building\" spice is toasting the spices before creating the food and layering in spices. Layering spices, some fresh, some toasted &amp; ground, at different stages is very important at the very beginning and end. The only thing I disagree with in your first comment is: > It's because of garam masala only. It's not ONLY because of the garam. There are many different types and the different ways you cook with spices affect the way they come out. Garam masala by itself is not spicy, imo. Say for example, did you toast the spices, grind and then use water or broth for the sauce. Using water or broth will result in a very different product. Also using a paste of fresh peppers and garlic, and cooking down your onions with it plays a huge role.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1526070547}}

It should be, once it's properly seasoned it will develop it's own nonstick pantina http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/features/wokcare.html First cook the chicken/meat get the wok hot then throw in a small amount of high heat oil such as safflower or grapeseed. Move the wok around to distibute the oil. Throw in a small amount of the meat slightly bigger than the flat part of the wok at most coated with s&amp;p no marinades. Let it sit for several minutes, do not stir. Flip it over and let it sit for sevral more minutes. Stirfry untill fully cooked. It is critical to use a small amount of meat cut in small pieces and to let it sear for several minutes. Gets nice browned char marks and avoids steaming. Use damp paper towles to absorb any moisture and cook the meat/chicken in batches. Next cook the vegies. Add more oil, add garlic, cook for a few minutes, then add chillis, wit a few more minutes then add whatever other vegtables you want, stirfry until done. If you are using a lot of vegies you may want to look into just cooking the garlic and chilis in the wok and steaming or blanching the other veggies. Or just cook them in small batches in the wok. Absorb the moisture with a towel, add the chicken until everything is hot. Then serve with sauce on the side. You could put the stirfry on a serving platter or even in a large tupperware container for easy cleanup and then add the sauce to the stirfry. Do not ever add sauce to the wok, it will remove part of the pantina. tldr Use seasoned carbon steel wok cook meat in small bathces sear meat for sevral minutes before stirfrying cook vegies seprately, also in small batches do not add sauce to wok","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1350593670"}}

{"text":"Summer or winter truffles? Generally speaking, winter has more pronounced flavour &amp; goes really well in cooking, as the flavour seeps throughout. A little goes a long way. Wrap them in a dry kitchen towel (paper) and store in a cling wrapped container in a cool, dry place. Change the paper daily to avoid moisture. I wouldn\u2019t keep it for longer than a week in this fashion, as you\u2019ll start to lose the aroma &amp; damp will promote mould growth. If desired, shave and infuse into oil, then you\u2019ll have your very own truffle oil, which you can use to flavour anything you fancy, or as a very indulgent finishing oil. Best uses for fresh truffle are: shaved on top of a cream sauce based pasta dish (either microplane or very fine shavings, you can also put into the sauce itself though truffle oil is generally better in the sauce), shaved over poached eggs or mixed into scrambled eggs, in cream based sauces, microplaned into whipped butter, shaved on top of beef, added into silky smooth mashed potato, or the ever classic truffle risotto (add the truffle in the last 10 minutes of cooking, as cooking truffle for too long will result in a loss of aroma) - the uses are endless!

{"text":"That's the correct cut of pork, but I see a lot of problems with your recipe. * Brining the meat is fine if you want (add some liquid smoke to it if you want BBQ pulled pork!), but you definitely need to have a dry rub on the meat as well so the surface dries out and develops a crust. Any pork rub is fine, but it should at least have salt, pepper, and sugar in it. Spreading yellow mustard on the meat before applying the rub will help it bind to the meat (it doesn't really affect the flavor). * Searing is not necessary beforehand IMO. I prefer to pan fry my pulled pork a little at a time after it's done cooking. It will start to fry in it's own fat and get crispy and delicious. * Adding liquid is not required at all. This is a big cut of meat with lots of natural juices. Just wrap the meat tightly in 2-3 layers of thick foil after applying the rub and put it in a pan in case it leaks. Once it's done, pour off the juices then add them back to the meat after pulling/chopping. Also, don't add anything fancy to it yet. Keep it simple. Once you know you can cook it properly you can start experimenting with other spices/aromatics. * Most important: tough cuts of meats like this need to be cooked low and slow to break down the collagen, which is why yours was chewy. 4 hours at 350 is not exactly low and slow. Try 6-10 hours at 250 instead. The internal temperature for slow-cooked meat should be around 190. You can also tell when it's done when the shoulder bone releases easily from the meat. This is kind of an oven BBQ method that I do pretty often, but it is just as good for tacos depending on how you season it or what sauce you decide to add. One last note: Authentic Mexican carnitas are deep fried for several hours in animal fat and some aromatics including orange peels. You're never going to achieve that level of deliciousness by doing it in the oven, but this technique should get you damn close.

{"text":"I use a 12-quart Revereware stock pot that I've had for ages. After ~4 hours of simmering, when I strain out all the chicken and veggies and skim off the fat, I end up with 15 - 20 cups of stock to freeze. And there's something about making stock--it smells wonderful on the stove, it steams up my windows, and it makes me feel all warm and cozy and well-provisioned when I've made a big batch and stored it away. If you decide to invest in a bigger stock pot, Revereware is great stuff. It cooks evenly enough for most applications, it's non-reactive, it lasts forever, and it costs a lot less than a lot of the newer, sexier brands. It isn't non-stick but it's easier to clean than you'd expect, unless you really burn something onto it. Revere's classic line is stainless steel with a copper bottom. Most collectors prefer the older stuff (pre-1968) to what they're making now, because they made it with thicker metal back then.

If you want to make your own pickles or something, go ahead and do that. To me though, the biggest thing you can do this early is to have a detailed plan of everything you're going to need to do. If dinner is at 6, when do things go into the oven? will the meat have time to rest? etc. Make sure your grocery list has every single ingredient you'll use, right down to extra salt and pepper if there's even a possibility of running out. Mise en Place is helpful when you don't want to forget anything for day-of-event cooking. Buy some disposable plastic bowls for your mise en place so you can throw them away and save on dishes. Make sure you have plates and cups etc. for the number of guests you expect, and maybe a couple extra. If there's something there you haven't made before, consider making a small portion now, just to watch it come together and get a feel for how long it will take you. If it's good, you'll want it again in 4 weeks, if it's not you have time to figure out why or pick something else. Knowing your recipes inside and out will make prepping everything else go smoothly.

{"text":"Ohh ooh, I got this. I've been getting ready to move and I've been cutting back on cookware, and researching what's worth keeping. I've got two SS pans that I've been playing with, and reading about. So what I'm currently doing is: If I want to cook something like eggs with a nonstick surface, I'll preheat the pan until a drop of water dashes around the pan like crazy, then add some vegetable oil (olive oil has a lower smoke point and might not work so well). Immediately or right before, drop it down to a low medium heat. The pan is 'charged' with heat, and if it has a thick bottom with an aluminum sandwich, it will stay perfect while cooking. The oil will start smoking a little. Perfect. When you get oil smoking, it's transforming at the contact point with the metal and beginning to polymerize[1]. You don't want it to turn black like with a cast iron; that is a much more complicated process and they can take the heat needed to polymerize oil to a great nonstick surface[2]. If you have too much heat, take it off the burner entirely. If you drop an egg on, you don't want it to explode; just a nice sizzle (you have to get to know your pans and how they react; I ate a lot of eggs this week experimenting). Alternatively, you can add a layer of oil first, then heat up the pan to beginning to smoke, then immediately remove from heat. That will achieve about the same effect, and give you a vaguely mirror like coating on the pan which is stick-resistant. You should need less or no oil to cook an egg. After forming that thin semi-polymerized layer, hard cookware and soap will remove the coating, so be gentle. If you want to make a gravy though (or brazing beef/chicken), wash with soap and water to remove any semi-polymerized oil. The steel will chemically bond to the meat, forcing GREAT heat transfer, giving you a cripsy skin. Once you see the meat beginning to peel away from the pan, it's most likely ready to let go and you can turn it to a new side. You WILL end up with stuck bits, 'frond' or 'foundation', which can be deglazed with any liquid to make a nice gravy [3]. [1] I've also seen a professional chef describe the situation as the metal changing shape and smoothing itself, forcing oil to sit on top. However, chemically, the oil should be polymerizing as well, and will remain after a good wiping down. [2] Cast irons will polymerize oil into a plastic substance, basically the original teflon. After that, you bake them/cook them until you get a perfect, tough polymer coating (and many layers of it). Cast iron can take the heat without warping, but stainless/aluminum will often warp. Additionally there is Carbon Steel, which has a lower carbon content than cast iron (yes), which can take the heat to form a full polymer coating, but will rust like cast iron, where SS has enough chromium to form a protective oxide layer. [3] If you accidentally stick something to a pan that you didn't want to stick, you can make cleaning way easier with deglazing. Stuck egg? Beef? Fish? Once you'r done with the pan, add some water, put it on medium-high, and step away until you have a nice boil. Scrape with a soft utensil and everything besides heavily polymerized fats will come right off. :) Edit/tldr: If you want nonstick, form a nonstick polymerized coating by making high temp oil smoke a tiny bit first. If you want gravy/brazing, start with a perfectly clean pan, get hot, add meat, let sit until meat doesn't resist.

The reason that Le Creuset and Staub are expensive pots is because they have multiple layers of enamel (called \"hard coat enamel\") whereas other brands like Lodge and Tramontina use one layer (\"porcelain enamel\") which is thinner and more easily damaged. You will eventually crack the enamel on a Lodge or Tramontina pan. A friend of mine cracked his only a few months after receiving it (I was shocked, but he didn't seem to think it was a big deal). It is simply much harder to crack a hard coat pot. Also, Le Creuset has a lifetime warranty (it's limited, but they seem to be good about honoring the warranty). It might make sense to just get the Lodge and replace it. For the cost of one Le Creuset, you can get three Lodge pots, so it might just make more sense to replace three Lodges for the price of one Le Creuset.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1472154064}}

Get some salt and pepper. Some chili powder, some cumin, some rosemary. A jar of beef boullion. A bag of all-purpose flour. With this, you can (if you can boil water and count) make \"student food\" - pasta with a can of tomatoes dumped over it. If you're too hung over to manage a can opener, you can still make buttered noodles, possibly with cheese on top, which might not cure a hangover but at least won't make it worse. If you can get your hands on some fish (frozen is fine... cheap stuff like perch, basa/swai, etc is fine), you can make cioppino, which is just about the easiest, most idiot-proof soup there is. If you can make cioppino successfully, you can make chili, with cheese and sour cream/crema. Make a lot. It keeps well, and it freezes. If you get bored with it, you can put it on hot dogs, or put it on baked potatoes. If you can make chili, it's time for Oven 101, after which you can make baked potatoes, make macaroni and cheese from scratch, and experiment with roasting vegetables.

As for making the burger itself, I normally mix 1 pound of meat with just salt and pepper and 1 slice of white bread that's been soaked in milk. Mix it only enough to make it evenly incorporated, that keeps the burger from being too dense. As for a barbecue sauce, here's my recipe for a Memphis style sauce 16oz Ketchup or other tomato product 12oz Cider Vinegar 2oz Brown Sugar 2tablespoons Onion Powder 2oz Worcestershire Sauce 2oz Dijon Mustard Mix all ingredients in a sauce pot and bring to a simmer.

{"text":"Your anti-alton tirades make you come off looking really bad despite your obvious skill and experience. At best you come off looking jealous and petty and at worst you come off as hypocritical. Consider, you complain that most people don't know how to cook. Alton Brown has taught at least 10 people I know in person (myself included) how to cook by way of his television show. I have interacted with literally 100's more who have been inspired to pass on hot pockets or the olive garden to try and cook something themself. And despite what you say Alton espouses exactly what you claim to extol - being more self sufficient in the kitchen. While some things are obviously foolish or silly sniping at a successful TV chef that inspires thousands upon thousands who, unlike you, can use some judgement and overlook or ignore poor suggestions like drill powered pepper grinders doesn't make sense. Instead of being jealous and negative why not ignore him or find the positive in his successes? Here is one success that Alton Brown has achieved: He inspired me to learn to cook. As a result, both my daughters learned to cook and as a direct result I teach a one week girl scout class on ow to cook. I teach local college kids how to cook (also in a one week class). I also teach kids at summer camp how to cook (two weeks a year). So, yeah, no. Alton Brown is not fucking my wife. He is a successful and inspirational TV cook. You are not in competition with him nor is he you. But no matter how good you can prepare food I'd give AB's restaurant a shot way before I gave yours a chance. Why? Even if you were the better chef? Easy, both of you cook to earn money. But AB does it while making the world a slightly better place (either by chance or design)","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1398887290"}}

{"text":"Most brown discoloration you get from cooking on a stainless steel pan is called fond and you can deglaze it with some liquid and make a tasty pan sauce. You might end up with some polymerized oil that doesn't come off easily with dish soap and sponge. That can be cleaned off with something like barkeepers friend or just simple abrasion with scouring pads or steel wool if the stain is very stubborn. There is always a risk of fire when you at trying to get a pan smoking hot. Even if you are heating the pan without a flame, it can catch fire when you get your oil hotter than it's autoignition temperature. It is not a reason not to use stainless steel, it just means that you have to be more careful. Cast iron is like a freight train, it takes a lot of heat energy to move its temperature up or down compared to stainless steel, you have a smaller margin of error when controlling your temps. You usually don't want a lot of smoke when cooking a steak, you want to keep the pan below the cooking oil's smoke point.

You'll need four duck legs (with thighs). Salt them (30g coarse salt sound vaguely familiar to me but I usually eyeball it) and season with thyme, juniper berries and black pepper and leave in the fridge overnight. In the morning clean the salt off (some people wash the meat, I never do because Raymond Blanc says not to). Put in a casserole dish or similar and cover with duck or goose fat and cook in the oven on a very low heat for about 4 hours. Shred the meat and let it cool before adding 1-2tbsp of chestnut puree, 2 tbsp chopped chives and enough heavy cream to bimd it all together. Taste and adjust according to your preference. If it's too salty add more cream. This also freezes really well and can be used to made duck bon bons by rolling the mix into balls, refrigerating to firm them up, then breadcrumbing and deep frying.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1564444644}}

{"text":"Calphalon's 10inch Tri-Ply stainless pan is always at Macy's. If you can get it on sale or with a coupon, it should be around 30 bucks. The pan is awesome if you're a stainless steel fan - even heat distribution, extremely efficient heat conduction (you will never have to cook on high heat with this thing if you pre-heat properly), thick all around (not just on the bottom), stainless steel handle (withstands the oven) that stays cool during stovetop use. The only issue with it is that the steel used tends to get black stuff baked into it - almost like a cast iron seasoning. It's really weird. However, it can be removed with Barkeeper's Friend (about $2 at any grocery store cleaning section or Home Depot) or just a bit of work with a steel wool. Or, you can just ignore it since it won't come off. I also tend to think that carbonized pans are a badge of honor, a sign of meals prepared, so it doesn't bother me at all. The only issue is that 10inch might be too small if you're cooking for a family. EDIT: after reading some replies on here, this will probably be one of the more expensive ways to go. I agree with perrycox - IKEA is pretty awesome. Aluminum - eh. AFAIK all hard-anodized (black) aluminum pans are nonstick, which is not what you're looking for. Bare aluminum is used by restaurants, and I've made cheese sauce in a bare aluminum pot before. The pros of it are that it's light, absurdly cheap, a top-notch conductor, and obviously tough enough for commercial duty. You treat it just like stainless steel. The cons are reports that it can interact with acidic food, although I wonder if the Aluminum Oxide coating (naturally forms in a microscopic, air-tight layer when truly bare aluminum is exposed to air) would protect the pan from acid. That would mean that you should avoid using metal utensils in an aluminum pan... but this is all guesswork. I've never used it at home. I would go ahead and not worry about the Alzheimer's thing simply because so many restaurants use them.

Works like a charm everytime :) Ingredients: 1 Cup AP Flour 1 Cup Cornmeal 6 Teaspoons Baking Powder 1/2 Teaspoon Salt 2 Tablespoons White Sugar 1 Cup Milk 1/2 Cup Vegetable Oil 2 Eggs 1. Place large iron skillet into your oven and preheat to 350F. (If you don't own an iron skillet or don't want to use one, any pan would do, and you don't have to put in it the oven while it preheats.) 2. Mix all dry ingredients together in a large bowl. 3. Make a well in the dry ingredients and add the milk oil, and eggs. Stir together until mixed. Batter should be smooth. 4. Remove iron skillet from the oven after it is finished preheating. Pour a few tablespoons of vegetable oil into the pan and rotate to coat. Pour in cornbread batter and shake gently until even. 5. Bake the cornbread for 20-25 minutes until the top is slightly browned and a toothpick or knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool for a few minutes and then serve. I love this cornbread by itself with butter, topped with black eyed peas (a new year's day traditional meal in my family) or with chili and soups. Hope you enjoy! EDIT: Posted this before I saw OP asked for descriptors. This recipe produces a cornbread that is somewhat dense and holds together well and tastes slightly sweet. The extra baking powder makes it a little fluffier than other cornbread I've tried, and heating the skillet before pouring in the batter makes the outside come out crispier on the bottom and the sides.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1382641378"}}

{"text":"How about some of my Spanish Chicken Pot Roast? Can either be done in a slow cooker or in the oven on low (just adjust the cooking times a bit), pretty cheap in terms of ingredients and a real crowd pleaser. Recipe: For the chicken with spice butter: 50g room temp butter 1 tsp paprika Zest of 1 lemon 1 tsp dried oregano 2 garlic cloves, minced Salt and pepper 1 whole chicken, about 1.5kg For the veggies: 2 red peppers in chunks 2 onions in 1/8ths 1 punnet cherry tomatoes 3 carrots, in batons 3 tsp fennel seeds 1 whole head of garlic, topped 1 tbsp balsamic or sherry vinegar 250ml/1 cup white wine Salt and pepper For roast potatoes: 6 medium maris piper potatoes in chunks Sage Instructions: This recipe requires a slow cooker with an oven safe pot. Preheat the oven to 220C. Prepare the spice butter by mixing butter, paprika, oregano, zest, garlic to make a paste and spread all over the chicken, including putting some under the breast skin if you like. Brown in the oven for about 15 minutes breast side up. While the chicken is in the oven, prepare all the vegetables to go straight into the slow cooker (excluding the potatoes, which go into a pan of cold water, bring to boil and parboil for about 7 minutes). When the chicken comes out the oven, transfer to the slow cooker, breast down (reserve the fat in the pan for potatoes). Add the wine, vinegar and fennel seeds. Set the slow cooker to high for one hour, after which switch it to low for 3 hours. When the potatoes are parboiled, drain the pan, add sage and then with the lid on give the pan a good rattle to fluff the potatoes up a bit and set aside. Once the 4 hours of slow cooking are up, preheat the oven to 190C. Place the potatoes into the roasting pan with reserved chicken fat plus a little olive oil if need be, and put in the oven along with the crock pot (lid off) to finish off for one hour.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1384101930"}}

I think the only determining factors in how long you keep the oil is (a) how much crap you leave floating around in there, and (b) how many times you use it. After 3 or 4 batches in the same oil, I'll do a test run with one piece of whatever I'm frying. You can tell when your oil is too old, because too much oil gets absorbed without driving off enough water, so you get soggy/greasy instead of crisp fried goodies. But here's a trick I took away from all my years in food service - I save a portion of the old grease (not much, a cup at most) and mix it into the new.

{"text":"Calling it cheese is almost a joke, but I 100% agree that american cheese is essential for a US-style burger. I didn't realize it was a minority opinion, honestly. If the cheese isn't melty, can you really call it a cheeseburger? I like a bleu cheese burger occasionally, but there you basically need to make a bleu cheese mornay sauce to get it creamy and melty enough for the burger. With kraft american slices, it melts effortlessly and deliciously. A local burger joint does shredded cheddar (or \"cheddar\" american, probably) on its burgers. They add a TON, and it never melts, so you end up with this pile of shredded, uncooked cheese on top. It's a drag, to say the least. You'll get some melted cheese, and I usually scrape off the rest. I'd prefer that they just used less cheese and ensured that all of it was properly melty. The burger weight thing. When I was a cook, I unabashedly used burger weights to speed up cooking time. But an unweighted burger tastes so much better, because you don't force the juices out. The only benefit I see from a burger weight is speed. It cooks So. Much. Faster., particularly if you preheat the weight on the griddle. But when you use it, you can clearly see a trail of juices running from the burger. If you heat the burger without the weight, all that juice remains intact, and it's delicious. Just let the patty fry on the griddle until cooked on one side, then flip and let it brown on the other side, then add the cheese on top shortly before serving so that it melts.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1417926664"}}

I also like to finish the lentils with a splash of vinegar (sherry vinegar is my preference), which brightens the flavors considerably. You don't need to worry very much about ratios and amounts. An even simpler recipe than above would include: a bag of lentils, an onion, a large carrot (or two), a quart of chicken stock, some sausage, salt, pepper, bay leaf (optional), and some vinegar (or even lemon juice) to finish. Brown the meat, remove, caramelize the onions, add the carrots, lentils, stock, simmer for 15 minutes, add back the meat, and simmer for 15-20 minutes longer (add some water throughout the process if needed).

{"text":"I've read a lot about how professional chefs use a microwave. They say it's good for boiling water quickly and softening butter, and that's about it. They don't use it to reheat foods or cook because of the way they work. A microwave reheats food in a really weird way. There are hot spots and it cooks very weirdly. I got tired of eating food that has been reheated in such a weird way. Again, I feel like microwaves are a 1970s fad, and most people would do well to use a microwave much less. I got rid of mine years ago, and each time I consider buying one I talk myself out of it since the use is so limited. I have an electric kettle and I'm not regularly softening butter. Unless you're drinking extreme amounts of soda, you can get 2L bottles of soda for about $0.50-$0.70. The time it takes to offset the purchase price of the machine and bottles is like 10 years. Also soda should be seen as a treat, if you're drinking soda water daily you're not living frugally, no matter how you get your soda.

{"text":"Pot-in-pot the IP makes ok rice. 1:1 rice:water otherwise it's still soggy. Good for anything with really long cooking times (beans!), or if you want to make soups (from frozen ingredients is ok too). It doesn't save much if any time for quick things like steaming veggies or cooking potatoes because it takes quite a while to heat up. Figuring out cooking times takes a bit of practice because even the quick steam release is not instantaneous. The IP is bad at small portions unless you go pot-in-pot and you need a fitting pot lid for anything that requires evaporation (and at that point I can just use a normal pot that is easier to handle). Because it's so deep compared to its diameter and the pot turns, without a handle to hold on to it, searing stuff inside is much more of a hassle than a pan, the uneven heating doesn't help either. I guess for your purposes, and how well you already get along with a rice cooker, replacing it would be the best option of the three.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":1533877482}}

For example, Vidalia onions must be produced within a certain region around Vidalia, Georgia, as defined by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, and \"100% Florida orange juice\" is certified as being such by that state's Department of Citrus. Some of these marks are protected in the United States under certification mark law, such as the Idaho Potato Commission's \"Idaho\" and \"Grown in Idaho\" registered trademarks for potatoes. Tennessee whiskey is straight Bourbon Whiskey produced in the state of Tennessee. This definition is legally established under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which states that Tennessee whiskey is \"a straight Bourbon Whiskey authorised to be produced only in the State of Tennessee.\" There also are cases in which a geographical name has been trademarked for a particular product that might not even be manufactured there, such as Philadelphia cream cheese. However, because the several states are limited in sovereignty under the United States Constitution, these types of laws are extremely limited in terms of enforcement, except to the extent that they are backed by various U.S. federal laws.
