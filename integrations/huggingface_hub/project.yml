title: "Hugging Face Hub integration"
description: >
  With [Hugging Face Hub](https://https://huggingface.co/), you can easily share any trained pipeline with the community. The Hugging Face Hub offers:


  - Free model hosting.

  - Built-in file versioning, even with very large files, thanks to a git-based approach.

  - In-browser widgets to play with the uploaded models.


  This uses [`spacy-huggingface-hub`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-huggingface-hub) to push a packaged pipeline to the Hugging Face Hub, including the `whl` file. This enables using `pip install`ing a pipeline directly from the Hugging Face Hub.

# Variables can be referenced across the project.yml using ${vars.var_name}
