# ü™ê spaCy Project: Hugging Face Hub integration

With [Hugging Face Hub](https://https://huggingface.co/), you can easily share any trained pipeline with the community. The Hugging Face Hub offers:

- Free model hosting.
- Built-in file versioning, even with very large files, thanks to a git-based approach.
- In-browser widgets to play with the uploaded models.

This uses [`spacy-huggingface-hub`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-huggingface-hub) to push a packaged pipeline to the Hugging Face Hub, including the `whl` file. This enables using `pip install`ing a pipeline directly from the Hugging Face Hub.


## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command       | Description                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `login`       | Log in to Hugging Face and download a model      |
| `preprocess`  | Convert the data to spaCy's binary format        |
| `train`       | Train a named entity recognition model           |
| `evaluate`    | Evaluate the model and export metrics            |
| `package`     | Package the trained model so it can be installed |
| `push_to_hub` | Push the model to the Hub                        |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | `preprocess` &rarr; `train` &rarr; `evaluate` &rarr; `package` &rarr; `push_to_hub` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets)
in the project directory.

| File | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`assets/fashion_brands_training.jsonl`](assets/fashion_brands_training.jsonl) | Local | JSONL-formatted training data exported from Prodigy, annotated with `FASHION_BRAND` entities (1235 examples) |
| [`assets/fashion_brands_eval.jsonl`](assets/fashion_brands_eval.jsonl) | Local | JSONL-formatted development data exported from Prodigy, annotated with `FASHION_BRAND` entities (500 examples) |
