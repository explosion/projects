# 🪐 spaCy Project: Streamlit integration

> ⚠️ This project template uses the new [**spaCy v3.0**](https://nightly.spacy.io), which
> is currently available as a nightly pre-release. You can install it from pip as `spacy-nightly`:
> `pip install spacy-nightly`. Make sure to use a fresh virtual environment.

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) is a Python framework for building interactive data apps. The [`spacy-streamlit`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-streamlit) package helps you integrate spaCy visualizations into your Streamlit apps and quickly spin up demos to explore your pipelines interactively. It includes a full embedded visualizer, as well as individual components. If you're training your own pipelines, you can integrate the `visualize` command into your `project.yml` and pass in the path to your exported pipeline to visualize it. See the tutorial project templates for examples.

## 📋 project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://nightly.spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ⏯ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://nightly.spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `install` | Install dependencies and download models |
| `visualize` | Visualize a pipeline interactively using Streamlit |
