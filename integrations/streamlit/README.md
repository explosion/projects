# 🪐 Weasel Project: Streamlit integration

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) is a Python framework for building interactive data apps. The [`spacy-streamlit`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-streamlit) package helps you integrate spaCy visualizations into your Streamlit apps and quickly spin up demos to explore your pipelines interactively. It includes a full embedded visualizer, as well as individual components. If you're training your own pipelines, you can integrate the `visualize` command into your `project.yml` and pass in the path to your exported pipeline to visualize it. See the tutorial project templates for examples.

## 📋 project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[Weasel documentation](https://github.com/explosion/weasel).

### ⏯ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`weasel run [name]`](https://github.com/explosion/weasel/tree/main/docs/cli.md#rocket-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `download` | Download models |
| `visualize` | Visualize a pipeline interactively using Streamlit |
