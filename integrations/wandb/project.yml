title: "Weights & Biases integration"
description: "Use [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) for logging of training experiments. This project template uses the IMDB Movie Review Dataset and includes two workflows: `log` for training a simple text classification model and logging the results to Weights & Biases (works out-of-the-box and only requires the `[training.logger]` to be set in the config) and `parameter-search` for programmatically creating variants of the config for a simple hyperparameter grid search, running the experiments and logging the results."

# Project commands, specified in a style similar to CI config files (e.g. Azure
