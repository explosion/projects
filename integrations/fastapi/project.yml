description: "Use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to serve your spaCy models and host modern REST APIs. To install the dependencies and start the server, you can run `spacy project run start`. To explore the REST API interactively, navigate to `http://${vars.host}:${vars.port}/docs` in your browser. See the examples for how to query the API using Python or JavaScript."
