# ü™ê spaCy Project: FastAPI integration

Use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to serve your spaCy models and host modern REST APIs. To install the dependencies and start the server, you can run `spacy project run start`. To explore the REST API interactively, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs` in your browser. See the examples for how to query the API using Python or JavaScript.

## üìã project.yml

project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).
