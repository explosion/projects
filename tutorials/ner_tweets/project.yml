title: "Detecting people entities in tweets (Named Entity Recognition)"
description: |
  This project demonstrates how to improve spaCy's pretrained models by
  augmenting the data and adapting it to a different domain.

# Variables can be referenced across the project.yml using ${vars.var_name}
vars:
  config: "config.cfg"
  name: "ner_tweets"
  version: "0.0.0"

# These are the directories that the project needs. The project CLI will make
# sure that they always exist.
directories: ["assets"]

# Assets that should be downloaded or available in the directory. We're shipping
# them with the project, so they won't have to be downloaded. But the
# 'project assets' command still lets you verify that the checksums match.

# Workflows are sequences of commands (see below) executed in order. You can
# run them via "spacy project run [workflow]". If a commands's inputs/outputs
# haven't changed, it won't be re-run.
