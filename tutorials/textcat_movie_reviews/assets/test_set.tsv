Sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation .	2
On the surface , it 's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with Piesiewicz 's and Kieslowski 's earlier work , films like The Double Life of Veronique .	2
Gangs of New York is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up .	2

Part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole .	2
For all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .	2
Morton is , as usual , brilliant .	2
Excellent acting and direction .	2
Why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me .	2
The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .	2
Lacking gravitas , MacDowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel .	2
A yarn that respects the Marvel version without becoming ensnared by it .	2
Even when foreign directors ... borrow stuff from Hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting .	2
If it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right .	2
Highlights are the terrific performances by Christopher Plummer , as the prime villain , and Nathan Lane as Vincent Crummles , the eccentric theater company manager .	2

There 's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film ... or the emotional integrity of the performances .	2
Though it is by no means his best work , Laissez-Passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them .	2
Evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children -- and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good .	2
... routine , harmless diversion and little else .	2
The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .	2
Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .	2
Remember the kind of movie we were hoping `` Ecks vs. Sever '' or `` xXx '' was going to be ?	2
Thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun .	2
No telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie .	2
Roger Michell , who did an appealing job directing Persuasion and Notting Hill in England , gets too artsy in his American debut .	2
Watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay 's sappier elements ... and sustains Off the Hook 's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer .	2

The stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for Euro-film pretension .	2
The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .	2
The French are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the Americans , who have a passion for Musketeers , only to spoof them .	2

The unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right .	2
Elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it 's therapeutic to laugh along with them .	2
The film 's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .	2
Long Time Dead ?	2
The old-world - meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie 's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco Bollywood that , by the end of Monsoon Wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater .	2
By taking Entertainment Tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , Auto Focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing .	2
Boisterous and daft documentary .	2
A movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious Charlie Kaufman might object to .	2
Just a bloody mess .	2

A hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the Mason-Dixon line .	2
The story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?	2
This horror-comedy does n't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count Elvira 's hooters .	2
You 'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it .	2
As shaky as the plot is , Kaufman 's script is still memorable for some great one-liners .	2

It 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` Can This Marriage Be Saved ? ''	2
A captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners .	2
The movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .	2
A pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place .	2
Seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work .	2

I like the new footage and still love the old stuff .	2
One of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .	2
... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .	2
Inside the film 's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it 's not that , it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat .	2

A marvel like none you 've seen .	2

A stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for Kissinger as a calculating war criminal .	2
In the end , White Oleander is n't an adaptation of a novel .	2

Marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film .	2

But this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .	2
