title: "Detecting fashion brands in online comments (Named Entity Recognition)"
description: "This project uses [`sense2vec`](https://github.com/explosion/sense2vec) and [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy) to bootstrap an NER model to detect fashion brands in [Reddit comments](https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/). For more details, see [our blog post](https://explosion.ai/blog/sense2vec-reloaded#annotation)."

# Workflows are sequences of commands (see below) executed in order. You can
# run them via "spacy project run [workflow]". If a commands's inputs/outputs
# haven't changed, it won't be re-run.
workflows:
  all:
    - preprocess
    - train
    - evaluate

# Project commands, specified in a style similar to CI config files (e.g. Azure
# pipelines). The name is the command name that lets you trigger the command
# via "spacy project run [command] [path]". The help message is optional and
# shown when executing "spacy project run [optional command] [path] --help".
