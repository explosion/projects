title: "Categorization of emotions in Reddit posts (Text Classification)"
description: "This project uses spaCy to train a text classifier on the [GoEmotions dataset](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/goemotions) with options for a pipeline with and without transformer weights. To use the BERT-based config, change the `config` variable in the `project.yml`."

# Workflows are sequences of commands (see below) executed in order. You can
# run them via "spacy project run [workflow]". If a commands's inputs/outputs
# haven't changed, it won't be re-run.
workflows:
  all:
    - preprocess
    - train
    - evaluate
    - package

# Project commands, specified in a style similar to CI config files (e.g. Azure
# pipelines). The name is the command name that lets you trigger the command
# via "spacy project run [command] [path]". The help message is optional and
# shown when executing "spacy project run [optional command] [path] --help".
