title: "Predicting whether a GitHub issue is about documentation (Text Classification)"
description: "This project uses [spaCy](https://spacy.io) with annotated data from [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy) to train a **binary text classifier** to predict whether a GitHub issue title is about documentation. The pipeline uses the component `textcat_multilabel` in order to train a binary classifier using only one label, which can be True or False for each document. An equivalent alternative for a binary text classifier would be to use the `textcat` component with two labels, where exactly one of the two labels is True for each document."

# Workflows are sequences of commands (see below) executed in order. You can
# run them via "spacy project run [workflow]". If a commands's inputs/outputs
# haven't changed, it won't be re-run.
workflows:
  all:
    - preprocess
    - train
    - evaluate

# Project commands, specified in a style similar to CI config files (e.g. Azure
# pipelines). The name is the command name that lets you trigger the command
# via "spacy project run [command] [path]". The help message is optional and
# shown when executing "spacy project run [optional command] [path] --help".
